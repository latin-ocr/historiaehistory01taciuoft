,ι’ , κ course, only ascertainable within the same wide limits as that

of the ffiktort'es,—wider, in fact, as the only definite note of

- time contained in the work itself is ii. 61, fin. This must have

can hardly be sure that Tacitus would have felt bound to

It is presumable that Tacitus did not long survive the com-
pletion of this, his longest and, in general estimation‚ his
greatest work. There are no traces os his having either
begun to complete his History of the Empire by an account

'- of the reign of Augustus (Anu. iii. 24. 4), or to continue it,

 

according to his earlier intention (which that passage does
not prove him to have abandoned), to the end of Trajan's
reign, which he perhaps survived. The last thing we are
able to say of him with certainty is, that he was living and
writing, in the full vigour of his powerS, at the age of sixty-
five.

II.-CHARACTER AND OPINIONS OF TACITUS.

We have in this sketch of Tacitus' life treated the pro-
duction of his various books as incidents in his career, rather
than as constituting its substance. In the eyes of his con-
temporarieS, he was, primarily‚ the greatest orator of his age,
and, as orators should be, an able and judicious man of affairs ;
it was a minor matter to them, that he wrote powerfully and
incisively 3 it mattered still less that what he wrote is so
valuable as it is to uS. Pliny, to be sure, expects Tacitus'

¹ ' Htktories to be immortal, and is anxious to secure in them
