sion, because every one in Italy who had any sense of his own
dignity was drawn to Rome as the only place that offered a
career worthy of him. One other career, no doubt, there was
open to the local notable, viz.‚ the army3 and it was by
military service only that the notables of the Provinces had
yet begun to rise. But the traditions of the Republic had
still so much force, that the civil and military careers were
. intertwined in the case of aspirants to eminence 3 the manipu-
lars and centurions were a class apart from the mass of the
citizens, but the tribunes and legates of the legions were not
a class apart from, scarcely a separate profession among, the
mass of the minor nobility. It was expected that a young
noble should'serve a campaign or two before he entered the
Senate‚ just as it was expected that he should make himself
heard in the Law Courts 3 this custom must have sostened
the feeling of surprise when a person, whose name had only
been heard as that of a soldier, came forward as an aspirant
for civil distinction,1 and, as time went on, even to the Prin-
cipate (cf. Hz'st. i. 84. 10).

respectable family—from what part of Italy² is unknown—
which had received Roman citizenship from Sulla, and had
since then maintained with dignity, perhaps with distinction,
the equestrian rank to which its wealth entitled it.

The date of his birth can be more easily, though only in-

² It seems a very rash inference that C. Cornelius Tacitus must have
been a native of Interamna because his descendant M. Claudius Tacitus
was so. From the difference of gentile name, the descent was probably
in a female line 3 indeed, such seems to have been the opinion of the good
people of Terni, who put up a monument to their supposed townsman
Cornelius, on which not only Claudius Tacitus, but his uterine brother
Annius Florianus, are called his descendants.
