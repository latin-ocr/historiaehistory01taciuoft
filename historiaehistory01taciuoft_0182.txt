104 CORNELII TACITI

magnis motibus agebantur.

Vibius Crispus, pecunia, potentia, 2

ingenio, inter claros magis quam inter bonos, Annium Faustum,
equestris ordinis, qui temporibus Neronis delationes factita-

. verat, ad cognitionem senatus vocabat. ‘Nam recens, Galbae 3

principatu, censuerant patres ut accusatorum causae nosceren-
tur. Id senatus consultum varie jactatum et, prout potens vel

inops reus inciderat, infirmum aut validum retinebatur.

hoc terroris et propria vi Crispus incubuerat delatorem fratris

sui pervertere3 traxeratque magnam senatus partem, ut inde-

fensum et inauditum dedi ad exitium postularent.

apud alios nihil aeque reo proderat quam nimia potentia
accusatoris: dari tempus, edi crimina, quamvis invisum ac

nocentem more tamen audiendum, censebant.

certa] Such changes put despotism
in abeyance——the sanguine might
hope liberty was restored, though
anarchy was practically a likelier
result.

crispus] We have a more favour-
able character of him (applied, how-
ever, to a time some twenty years
later) in Juv. Sat. iv. 81 sqq.

claros] We have the same use
of the term in a doubtful compli-
ment in Sall. Jug. 8. 1, Liv. viii.
27. 3, where clari is opposed to
honesti.

delationes factitaverat] We
have similarly accusationem factitare
in Cic. Brut. 34. 130. chferre and
the cognate words did not get their
technical sense before the empire,
though their use in certain legal
phrases (defferre nomen, etc.) furnished
the germ of it.

3 accusatorum] Words of this
form have often the force of ‘ a man
in the lzabz't of doing ' the action of
the verb, and that is clearly the force
of this word here, and Cic. Brut. l.c.
So aedificator in Juv. xiv. 86, Nep.
Att. 11 ; so Cic. Tusc. iv. 12. 27,
distinguishes amator from amans, as
ebriosus from ebrius, or as anxietas
from angor, and iracundia from ira.

Et valuere

It would have been absurd to pro-
secute everybody whohad prosecuted
anybody; but it was seriously pro-
posed that actions should lie against
those who had made themselves a
character as prosecutors.

vane jactatum] Experienced
various changes of fortune. ‘ Was
variously carried out‚' though ex-
pressing the sense, is not atranslation.

retinebatux] Whether put in
force or not, it was never abrogated.

4 Ad hoc terroris] ‘ Besides the
threat thus held out ' by the Senate,
Crispus had motives of his own. It
is curious that we hear of him again
in iv, 42 sq.‚ as himself reckoned
among the most odious delatores.
Here potentia in ἓξ 2, 5 hints the
same, while we are told it expressly
at the end of the chapter.

fratris sul] Vibius Secundus,
Ann. xiv· 28. 3.

5 aeque . . . quam] The com·
mentators duly notice that Cic.
would have written aeque ac.

more] ‘According to rule,' the
reverse of sine more in Virg. Aen.
viii. 635. The simple amative,
almost equivalent to de more, is found
also in Cic. Off i. 41. 148, where
it is coupled with institutis civilibus.
