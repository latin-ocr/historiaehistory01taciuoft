scelus, the latter would give a more
forcible. antithesis to ob virtutes
certissimum exitium.

procurationes] The procurators
(at least the merely fiscal ones)
were no more than Caesar's
stewards; the governors, even of
an imperial province, bore more the
character of public functionaries.

interiorem emphasizes the force
potentiam always has (as noted
on 1. 2) of secret and, by implica-
tion‚ discreditable influence.

agerent verterent] The asyn-
deton is probably suggested by the
familiar phrase agere ferre

8] The slave is conceived as
being' 1n a personal relation to his
master, and under an obligation of
personal loyalty (pietas) to him.
Such is the sentiment of Virg. Aen.
vi. 613, ‘quique arma secuti Impia,
nec veriti dominorum fallere dextras. '
It is of course less unnatural to our
minds that such an obligation should
be conceived to exist on the part of
the freedman; as his master has
conferred rights on him, he may
lay claim to compensating duties.
But ancient (and particularly
Roman) moral, no less than legal,
conceptions, were ‘based on status,
not on contract‚’ nor even on reci-
procity.

CH. III. secutae . . . conjuges]
He is perhaps thinking of Fannia,
the wife of Helvidius, though his
death cut short the companionship

on his second banishment, which
alone would sall within this work.

audentes, constantes] 1f a man
embarked on a dangerous career,
relations of his own standing would
feel bound in honour to share it; it
would be enough for men of a
younger generation if they stood
by him when in trouble.

generi] For the tenderness of
this relationship at Rome, cf. Cat.
72. 4, ‘pater ut natos dilrgit et
generos.' In most states of society,
the first steps for arranging a mar-
riage are taken by the bridegroom
or his family ; at Rome they seem
to have been taken by the bride's
family. Plutarch thought it an
extreme case when Ap. Claudius
‘ courted ' Tib. Gracchus for his
daughter3 yet quaerere or deligere
generum are common phrases (ag.
inf. iii. 5. 4, of Thrasea and Hel·
vidius); while there 15 no Latin word
meaning distinctively‘ to woo,’ and
the substantive procus is rare in
prose, almost unknown in his-
torians. Writers of Epithalamia
thought it elegant to represent the
bridegroom at least as impassioned ;
but the ideal of sober moralists was,
that the honourable state should
be embraced apart from personal
bias, and this made it natural that
it should be a matter rather of
arrangement than of choice,—‘ne
tanquam maritum sed tanquam
matrimonium ament’ (cf. Germ.
