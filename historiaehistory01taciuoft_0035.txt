-os ’ these Christian quotations we leam, incidentally, how little

  Suetonius for them—who meant to give them what they

had not ceased to interest the class to which he belonged

ἵ J and for which he wrote, in the subscription of our ms. of the

apparently a man of rank, at the end of the fourth century.

the Renaissance by one of a higher order. Most historians

partialitieS, or even than opinions 3 and for his political

' „ ideas he has been mainly valued in modern times. The
