xxx INTRODUCTION.

in general 3 but undoubtedly Tacitus has been better under-
stood and appreciated for the last three centuries than ever
before.

Within the last few years a tendency seems to have arisen
to depreciate him unduly. A reaction has taken place from
the historica] school which “treated events as if they had
never happened 3⁷ and now, instead of looking at the events
