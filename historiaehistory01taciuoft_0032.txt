to the bookseller, or directed his own slaves to ⁸multiply
copies, We therefore cannot pretend to establish the exact
date of the publication of the ffi'ston'es as a whole, but we
may safely assign it to the early years of Trajan.

In his third year, A.D. 100, we have our last notice of a
fact in Tacitus’ personal history. The provincials of Africa
brought an action against their oppressive governor, Marius
Priscus: Tacitus and Pliny were appointed by the Senate to
conduct the prosecution. The conviction was easily obtained
—such prosecutions were not undertaken unless there was
good cause, and the Senate was far from desirous to screen
evil-doers. Marius was banished 3 we know not how much
weight to give to Juvenal’s hints, that his punishment sat
lightly upon him, and failed to carry with it any amends to
his victims, But there is perhaps some significance in the
fact, that with all Tacitus' celebrity as an orator, this is the
only instance where we hear in detail of a case in which he
was engaged. It shows, what he himself notes in the begin-

occupied, and how much less mark he left on history, than
in the latter ages of the Republic ; it perhaps may be held ’ ,³⁴
to show also, that Tacitus took little or no part in the crusade ¹
against delatores which followed the death of Domitian, as,
if he had done so, the fact would have found natural mention
in several of Pliny’s letters.

In the Preface to the ffi'storieS, Tacitus announces an
intention of employing his old age in writing the history of
the happy times of Nerva and Trajan. It is almost certain
that he never even commenced such a work. The composition
of the Annals, in fact, must have occupied nearly the whole
of the reign of Trajan, for though there were fewer difficulties
in the way of openly collecting evidence, the collection must
have been more laborious than when personal recollection
