98 CORNELII TACITI

Fama recentior tradit a Cinyra sacratum templum, deamque
ipsam conceptam mari huc pulsam. Sed scientiam artemque 2
haruspicum accitam, et Cilicem Tamiram intulisse; atque ita
pactum ut familiae utriusque posteri caerimoniis praesiderent.
Mox, ne honore nullo regium genus peregrinam stirpem ante· 3
celleret‚ ipsa quam intulerant scientia hospites cessere: tantum

Cinyrades sacerdos consulitur.
sed mares deliguntur: certissima fides haedorum fibris.

Cinyra] ,He at any rate is a
character of native or early natural-
ized Greek legend, always connected
with Cyprus, ll. xi. 10, Pind. Pytlz.
ii. But the name seems to be
Phoenician, cf. Melicertes.

2 haruspicum] Cicero (de Dz'v.
1. 2.) describes augury as the form
of divination most valued in Cilicia ;
and, of course he had means of
knowing. The Cilician origin of
one of the priestly houses may

therefore be a mere guess.

3 stu-pem antecelleret] The
construction with the dative is more
usual with this and equivalent verbs,
but the accusative is found occasion-
·ally in the silver age z e. g. in Tacitus
himself, Ann. xiv. 55. 7.

4 ut . . . sed] They may be of
any species or value, subject to the
restrictiori of sex.

precibus . . . adolentur] The
igne puro means simply ‘ bloodless.'
Probably incense would be used,
but it might mean only that a fire
was kept buming. In Ann. xiv.
30. 4 we have cruore captivo adolere
aras, which, coupled with this pas-
sage, supports the view that adoleo
originally means not ‘to cause to
smell,' but ‘to honour,' literally

Titus, spectata opulentia donisque regum, quaeque

‘ increase‚'—coming not from the
verb oleo, but from the root of
adolesco.

nee . . . madescunt] A belief
found at several other temples‚ speci-
fied by Polybius, xvi. 12. 3.

5 ratio in obscuro] We hear of
the worship of Bacrzma—sacred
stones—among the Phoenicians ; in
the O. T. we often have ‘pillars'
enumerated among objects of idola-
try, and the use of ‘ great stones ' as
sacred monuments, so frequent down
to the time of Samuel, would be a
natural germ of such worship. The
Caaba is too large for comparison,
though it illustrates the same fetishist
spirit. The statue (if it can be called
so) of the Suu-god at Emesa was of
the same shape as this ; it was black,
and said to be διιπετές, while the
material of this was unknown ; both
may therefore have been aerolites.
Our own ‘ Druidical ² monuments
are chiefly found in districts abound·
ing in boulders, ‘ sarsen stones‚' and
‘ erratic blocks‚’ that look as if they
had dropped from the sky rather
than been produced naturally where
they are found. But the description
(and figures on coins) of the Paphian
idol do not point to its being an un-
