INTRODUCTION. lxvii

found between'Terence and Velleius; but its occurrence in
early Latin perhaps shows that it is not a conscious Graecism.

He often employs an adverb by itself as predicate of a
sentence.

Some peculiarities in his use of particles have been already
noticed. He uses an for ‘ or,' where there is no question, and
without a particle in the clause expressing the first alternative,
oftener than any one else, though this is not altogether pecu·
liar to him.

He uses non and neque (rather than ne or neve), with the con-
junctive in an optative sense.

He has quamquam with the indicative perhaps more fre·
quently than usual.

In the order of words he varies from common usage more
than in constructionS. We have already noticed the frequency
of his keeping the subject to the end of the sentence 3 and as
he thus inverts the natural order in the sentence as a whole,
so. in the parts of it, or secondary predicationS. Thus we find
the adjective before the substantive more commonly in him
than in most Latin.

It seems to be almost a converse case to this, where the
cognomen is placed before the gentile name. The oegnomen
was a personal name in its later as in its earlier usage, though
in the two last centuries of the Republic it had become
virtually hereditary—yet not more than were certain prae·
nomina [see on ffl'st. ii. 48. 5] which of course were primarily
personal. Dio wrote (at least we can scarcely suppose that
Xiphilinus wrote out of his own head) Γάλβας ὃ Σὲρουιος ὁ
Σουλπίκιος. But though Tacitus does invert these names not
seldom, it can hardly be said to be a peculiarity of his ς names
had often been inverted, at least in poetry metri gratia, ever
since the days of the epitaph of

CORNELms anms Sermo BARBATUS.
