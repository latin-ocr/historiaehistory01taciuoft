odient] ‘ Had reached the quarters
of the legions, with commission to
take their command,’ Or. ; or, ‘ had
carefuuy inspected the winter quar-
ters of the legions,' C. and B. And
attention to the physical comforts
of his men was both natural to
Vitellius, who was so caresul os his
ἓξέἆ aulil helped him to secure their

wi .
2 ordines] Not ‘their ranks,'

but ‘their com anies,' and so prac-
timuy ‘ifle tang oi centurion!

mem] The singular is rare,
and as M. has sorde without a mark
over the e, it is easy to read sordes.
We have a similar case in 60. 1 ;
and perhaps the two help to justify
each other, considering Tacitus's
taste for unsamiliar expressions.
Perhaps there is a shade 'of differ-
ence in sense ; the plural is concrete
and material shabbiness, this mental
baseness.

3 Nec'. . . accipiebantur] ‘Nor
was his measure taken as that of a
legate and ex·consul‚ but all his
daims to consideration were taken

’ . at more than their worth.' The

next sentence points out that he
was thou ht to have personal as
well as o cial claims.

ut] Easily omitted, VTVIT.

faventes] ‘ Admiringly,’ not ‘ his
admirers‚' still less ‘ the admirer-s of
those qualities.’ Tacitus admits
(iii. 86. 3) that he deserved part of
their praise.

auena] That was not his, not
that it belonged to other men, but
to the state. If it had been the
result of confisoetions, he would
have made as many enemies as
friends.

imperandi] By making him em-
peror they would themselves secure

‘the power os the empire‚

4 uum . . . muni] ‘Many
as were the orderly and peaceable
rnen in both armies, there were as
many who were bad and vigorous.’
Multi, though shown by its position
to be meant for the subject of the
sentence, must be translated as a
predicate 3 the one class, as well as
the other, were numerous.

5 cunctationem] Whether to
accept the empire‚ sup. 8. 6,

7.
