vi INTRODUCTION.

safest to omit the praenomen altogether3 all our evidence
shows that his contemporaries usually spoke of him without it.

In Pliny's Natural H'tktory, vii. 17, we hear that a Cornelius
Tacitus, Procurator of Belgic Gaul, had an overgrown and
imbecile child, who—we are perhaps to understand—died in
convulsions at three years old. Now, the cognomen Tacitus
is not so common but that the identity of name creates a
presumption of relationship between the two men bearing it—
perhaps, even, that the elder was the natural or adoptive
father of the younger‚—though, if the historian's father was a
Cornelius, and his mother the sister or daughter of a Tacitus, Ἴ
whether Cornelius or no, this would account for his inheriting
the name. If we could be sure that the father of the mons-
trosity was the father of the historian, there would be a certain
interest in the fact, as proving that the elder Pliny was inti-
mate enough with the elder Tacitus to have seen a member
of his family who would naturally be kept out of sight 3 and
thus illustrating the beginnings of the friendship which we
know to have existed between their namesakes in the next
generation.

With the exception of this presumable relationship, we
know nothing¹ of Tacitus' family or descent. But the name
Cornelius, undoubtedly borne by him, suggests the question,
whether he belonged to a patrician house (though, if so, to
an obscure branch of it), or to a family admitted to citizen-
ship in comparatively modern times, presumably by Sulla.
It is consistent with either view, that his family should have
been of equestrian rank—neither nobles nor parvenus—as
we may conclude it to have been, not only from his supposed
relationship to the Procurator, but from his own statement in
Ηιῖςΐ. i. 1. 4, which implies that he had no hereditary claim
to be admitted to the Senate. On the one hand, there were
branches of the oldest houses (ag. of the Octavii) that never
