gratulates Rome and himself upon Nerva’s reconciliation of
two things formerly incompatible, the Empire and liberty,
the sentence is neither a flourish of rhetoric nor a courtly
commonplace 3 if we want to put the sentiment in a form
that shall bring out its weaker side, we may say that it is as
though our own Junius had announced the discovery, that
office was not absolutely incompatible with patriotism.
Under the hereditary Caesars—for the Flavian dynasty had
been even more strictly hereditary than the Claudian-the
Senate had indeed been the second power in the State, but
it had been chronically out of harmony with the first, and
therefore had been by various means neutralised and re-

it is worth inquiring why the earlier triumph lasted only for
six months, and the later for more than eighty years,——for at

of him as soon as they learnt that they themselves were to
gain nothing by their services but the credit of disinterested
patriotism. They fraternised with the household troops of
