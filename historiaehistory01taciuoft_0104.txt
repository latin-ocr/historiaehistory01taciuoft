intriguing for himself to stay or to
go, according as hope or sear was
the stronger influence on him per-
sonally.'

CH. XX. 1 Proxlma] The most
obvious sense to an English reader
is, ‘came next,' when the question
of the meeting in Ger-many was

patrimony, or perhaps more forci-
bly, ‘what belonged to other men,'
because Nero' s bounty was fed by
confiscations, as is said expressly
111

felsina] ‘Capitalss producing
interest, or invested productively-—a
less common meaning than‘ interest!

settled. But it is doubtful whether ⁴

the Latin word can mean 11115.
rather ‘the most anxious question
next to this was . . .'
lude..ub1] Praetieally equi-
valent to abiis. ‚apud quos; but
the measure is stated in an imper-
sonal form, to mask its invidious-
neSS. Unde is however used with

a distinctive personal antecedent in
Virg. Aen. i. 6, Hor. Od. i. 12. 16,

. and even Sat. i. 6. 12, where it=

a quo in the sense ‘ by whom.'

2 Bis et vicies mimos] An
unquestionable correction for bis et
vicies mille. Of course the cumbrous
nomenclature of the Roman money
of account makes textual corruptions
still easier than they always are
with numerals.

3 super . . . erant] For the
tmesis, cf. Virg. Aen. ii. 567.

auena] Opposed to sua as ‘ what
‘had been given them’ to their

Instrumenta vitzbrum.Cost1y show
and luxurious houses.
4 manta] Suetonius says fifty.
offiefl· never exactly means
‘office ε’ 11616 11 differs much as,
according to Demosthenes or Ctesi-
phon, ἐπιμέλειά τις καὶ διακονία (1065
from ἀρχή. (Α65611. 111 Ct. ἓ 13.)
ambitu] Best taken in the usual
sense, either of the canvassing to
secure the charge, in hopes that
some of the money might stick to
the collector’s fingers‚ or perhaps
rather, the canvassing to which they
were exposed, on the part of the
possessors of grants. Else it may
be and sometimes is taken nearer
the etymological sense, ‘through
the wide range of their 111115ᾱ1611011,’
or ‘the extent of their circuit!
actionibus] So M, and it makes ·
better sense than the obvious guess‚
auctionibus, which adds nothing to
hasta et sector.
