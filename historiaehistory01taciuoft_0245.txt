fortunae et pravis magistris didicit aususque est. Propriis3

avidius de re publica sumeret. Ceteri conferendarum pecuni-

a war between two armies, not
between an invading army and a
nation in arms ς which would pre·

conscience or prudence. The at-

he gave judgment, right or wrong,
t every one whose property
was worth confiscating or fining—
perhaps also in favour of any one
who could only afford to bribe.

2 Quae . . . mansere] Probably
not actual corruption, but the harsh
enforcement of vexatious claims of
the Fiscus: cf. Juv. iv. 46- 56.

· ad obtinendas iniquitates] ‘In
holding his ground when wrong‚’
‘maintaining unjust acts.’ Haud
'nde may mean, not so much as
ucianus, or not as much as he
himself did afterwards.

3 quod. avidius] One copyist
not absurdly conjectures quo· The
fact is, that Tacitus begins the
sentence, meaning to put side

by side in contrast Mucianus's
private liberality and avarice at the
public eost. Then, when he has
(as 118 intended) stated the first
absolutely, it occurs to him to sa ,

the proper Latin for this would
have been eo privan'm largior quo
avz'ciius, etc. But he does not want
to alter the positive statement
largus privatim, and if he put quo
without the correlative comp. re-
ceding, it would be worse gan
ambiguous, as it would naturally
mean ‘liberal in order that he maght
take,' which is not the sense in·
tended. Accordingly, he writes
Ξέἕῖέΐὶἓὶἕῖἕηῗῖξῖἓ <¹3 333 3523.
that occurred to lum in the middle
of the sentence.

rarissimus quisque] ‘ It was at
very wide intervals that you found
any one who . . .’ The use of
quisque is more akin to that with
quotus and ordinal numerals, than
to the one with ordinary super·
latives; but Cic. Fin. ii. 25. 81,
optimum quidque rarissimum, may
be admitted as a partia] illustration.
