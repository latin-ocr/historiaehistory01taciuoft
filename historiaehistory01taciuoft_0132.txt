Tacitus is rather fond of the im-
personal construction with an oratio
obliqua ; ag. 90. 2 fin.

2 inpudicitia would be more
characteristic of Otho, ignavia of
Vitellius3 but either term appar·
ently would apply to both.

pars] Not quite our ‘stake in
the country‚' which implies some-
thing material, and to which, more-
over, no o'ne is essentially unable
to attain, but ‘all to whom the
country in any way belonged.'

3] They left off talking of the
instances they had seen of the
horrors of peace to speculate on
the horrid traditions of civil war.

saevae pacis exempla are the
severities of the empire; the re-
volution against Nero, the massacres
of Galba’s progress, and even the
death of the latter (iii. 68. 2) could
hardly be called events of even a
bloody peace.

totiens} See iii. 83. 3.

Pharsaliam Philippos balance in
some sort direptiones provinciarum,
and Perusiam ac Mutinam, vasti-
tatem Italiae. This is why Tacitus

groups them in pairs, and deserts
the chronological order.

4 principatu] ‘ The first place '
in the state, whether a constitu-
tional premiership or an usurped
monarchy.

inter bonos] The Caesars en-
joyed general admiration, while
both their generosity or policy and
the natural tradition of the aristo-
cracy combined to prevent respect·
able people from condemning the
Republican champions. But Taci-
tus is giving the popular opinion,
not his own; as he is not among
the worshippers of D. Augustus,
so he is more than suspicious of
Pompey's loyalty (ii. 38. 4).

imperium . . . rem p.] One
must translate ‘the Empire' and
‘ the Republic ' (cf. note on i. 1. 2),
but both the Latin words have
dignified associations which the
English have not. The paraphrase
‘the principle of sovereign autho-
rity was preserved, the principle of
national liberties would have been‚’
comes almost as near to expressing
the meaning.
