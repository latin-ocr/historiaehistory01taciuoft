INTRODUCTION. xlv

Suetonius thought Clemens’ character contemptible3 Tacitus
probably, from a political point of view, thought it worse ; and
pronounces the religion which made him what he was a deadly
superstition, hideous or shamefiss, which nothing but the
depravity of modern Rome saved from sharing in the sall os its
parent state.

Certain as it is that Tacitus rejected Christianity, whether
more or less deliberately‚ the question has some interest
whether his adherence to the historical religion and ceremonial
of Rome was hearty or indifferent. That it should be hearty
is not as impossible as is generally imagined. Cicero’s famous
saying about the two augum, coupled with the fact that he was
an augur himself, makes us think that the whole of Roman
paganism waS‚ so far as it affected educated people‚ a system
of organised hypocrisy, kept up for the restraint of the vulgar.

Ἣ “ But in the first place, we can hardly take Cicero’s sceptical

arguments in the De Divinatione as an expression of fixed dis·
belief on his own part 3 they do shOW, no doubt, that he saw
divination to be the ridiculous side of the traditional religion 3
but it appears from the same work, that he did not sear to
make his brother ridiculous by representing him as a believer
even in divination. And further, Cicero and Tacitus were
aster all not contemporaries; it is no more sels-evident that
the feelings of educated men were the same in the days of the
latter as of the former, than it would be safe to assume that the
opinions of Talleyrand are held by the present Bishop of Autun.
The augurs of Cicero's time knew that their art was chiefly
used to furnish pretexts for cancelling elections or interrupting
resolutions that were inconvenient to the party in power 3 but, ex
quo suffragia nulli vendimus, believers in augury, even if augurs

Books of the Hzlrtories there must have been a record of his death, but
the absence of allusion elsewhere seems to show that Tacitus regarded it
without interest or horror.
