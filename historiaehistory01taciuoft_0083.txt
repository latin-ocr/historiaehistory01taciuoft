musa] ‘ Let g0,' rather than
‘lost’ One might compare the
phrase mats-sum facere, ‘to dismiss,'
and Horace's non missura cutem
. . . hirudo (A. R, fin.) The
statement is only true if taken in
close connexion with perdomita.
Agricola marched, gaining victories,
to the extreme north, and the
country overrun by him was not
retained3 this Tacitus conceives as
a conquest of the whole island,
followed by a retreat within the
old limits.

neronis ludibrio] Probably not
that mentioned in ii. 8. 9, but one
more dangerous, in the time of
Domitian, or perhaps of Titus.
Nero’s personal popularity made
him one of the monarchs, like

James IV. and Sebastian, whose

death is disbelieved by the people ;
and such disbelief either passes into
a mythical expectation of his return
(as with Arthur or Barbarossa), or
gives an opening to a series of
human impostor-s (as with Demetrius
of Russia). With Nero, both re-
sults seem to have followed. And

mare] Probably ‘every island
was a prison,‘ possibly, ‘the sea
was covered with ships bearing men

infecti . . . soopnn] When
a man nominally exiled (see, ag.
46. 8) was to be executed or assas-
sinated (the line between the two
was imperceptible), of course the
place chosen for exile would not
only be isolated but desolate. Pos-
sibly also sometimes a cliff would
be chosen for the scene, to give a
colour of accident or suicide.
