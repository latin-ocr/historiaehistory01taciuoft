CORNELII TACITI

Miles ipsi adeo paratus, ut praeeuntem sacramentum, et fausta

Vitellio omina precantem, per silentium audierint.
animus nec Vespasiano alienus et in Titum pronior.
fectus Aegypti Ti. Alexander consilia sociaverat.

Prae·
Tertiam

legionem, quod e Suria in Moesiam transisset, suam numerabat.

Ceterae Illyrici legiones secuturae sperabantur, namque omnes 3

exercitus flammaverat adrogantia venientium a Vitellio militum,
quod truces corpore, horridi sermone, ceteros ut inpares inride-

bant.

Sed in tanta mole belli plerumque cunctatio 3 et Vespa· 4

sianus, modo in spem erectus, aliquando adversa reputabat ε·-
Quis ille dies foret, quo sexaginta aetatis annos et duos filios

juvenes bello permitteret?

Esse privatis cogitationibus pro-

gressum, et prout velint, plus minusve sumi ex fortuna:
imperium cupientibus nihil medium inter summa aut praecipitia.

CH. LXXIV. rfausta . . . pre-
cantem] Bona or fausta omnia
precari was the technical expression, ·
else some would read omina: M. has
an abbreviation, which though pro·
perly standing for omma, is some-
what ambiguous. The 'reluctance
of the soldiers to commit themselves
to the oath is stronger than that
described in i. 55. 1. It shows
how the longum Caesarum sacra·
mentum (i. 5. 1) had been depreciat-
ed by the extinction of the dynasty,
that Vespasian‚ a loyal soldier and
conscientious man as times went,
thought it worth while to take an
oath he meant to break immediately,
for the mere sake of sounding his
troops ε for Vitellius's alarm clearly
was not lulled long enough to
produce any practical effect of
surpnse.

2 nec . . .
5. 1.

e suria] M. has de, and the
insertion of α’ by διττογραφία here
is less likely a priori than the
omission of Ti by ὀμοιοτέλευτον
just above. But Or. doubts the
legitimacy of the construction

promor] See above,

transire de, though admitting that it
might have a distinctive sense—that
they had been withdrawn from
Syria, not simply sailed from Syria.

3 horridi sermone] ‘ Speaking
a rude dialect‚' C. and Β. If not
quite so much as this, the passage
clearly means that they were bar-
barized by their service on the
German frontier.

4 Esse privatis . . .] ‘ In private
designs there is room to advance
[or not]; private men may, as they
choose, draw more or less heavily
upon 'fortuna’ The subject to
velint is privata cogitantes, to be
supplied fromprivatzlr cogitationibus.
Sumi ex fortuna is probably to be
explained as above translated—-
fortune, instead of being personified‚
is conceived as an unappropriated
store of success for some unknown
comer :¹⁶or we might translate, ⁴ they
take more or less, according to their
fortune ¹—proportion their aims for
the future to their success in the

ast.

p mter summa aut praecipitia]

copies and the old vulgate substi-
