Tacitus is probably not wrong in
seeing‚ in this very Roman word,
the key to Roman history. The
men charged crimine regni affec-
tandi, from Cassius to the Gracchi,
were all doubtless guilty ospotentz'ae
cupzd0‚ which in a republic was
treasonable.

2 facile habebatur] ‘Was easily
maintazned' expresses the force of
the tense : the verb is as neutral in
sense as possible.

aemulis urbibus regibusve] The
contest with Carthage and with the
kings of Macedonia and Syria are
conceived as the turning point in
Roman history. Perhaps the con-
quest of Syracuse, Corinth, etc.‚ is
also referred to in urbibus ; it is
scarcely likely that he ranks Nu-

mantia with Carthage, like Cic. de
Am. 3. 11.

3 et . . . bellorum] ‘It was in
the capital and the forum that we
first essayed civil wars‚ ' C. and B.
He refers to the riots in which the
Gracchi were killed, and the rising
of Saturninus.

5 othonis ae Vitelffl exercitus]
The former included gladiators, the
latter was largely composed of Ger-
man barbarians; hence the antithesis
to civium legiones. They had not the
same motive (sense of common
patriotism) as the earlier armies for
abandoning the war, and they had
the same for continuing it as pre-
vailed even with the others.

6 bella] The wars of our times.
It is curious that here Otho is
