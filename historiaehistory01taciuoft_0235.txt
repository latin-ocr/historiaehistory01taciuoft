et apud victos plus querimoniarum quam virium. Fluxam ²
per discordias militum fidem, et periculum ex singulis: quid

Tacitean as it is more obvious.
The sense either way would be the
same, ‘no alternative between the
highest success and utter downfall '
(C. and Β.) ; but with et the words
could be translated, ‘there was no
ground intervening between re·
cipitous heights,' and to this alse
interpretation of a salse reading we

mutan] He had commanded a
legion in Germany itself, in the
reign of Claudius. But Tacitus

army, and the conditions of service

of his personal knowledge.

His main reliance was on his own
legions, including (74 2) the one
lately sent into Moesia: he had
a faint hope of desertion from
Vitellius, and a better one of sup·

to fight against Romans; the
Vitellians, if they did not care
much for their emperor, would

identify his cause with that of their
own pride; and the Othonians,
though discontented enough, had
been beaten once, and might be
again.

or e o a momen , or
perhaps rather, ‘ for a deed in their
power at a moment's notice.' The
antithesis os the collectives cohortes
alasque to unus alterque is meant to
explain cx singulis. Facinus is
hardly a word of moral blame ε see
on 5ο. 2. Praesens has been trans-
lated ‘ daring,’ like praesens animus
or virtus, but there the distinctive
force lies in the subst. It is doubted
whether facinora, the f.L of M„
should be converted into -ri or -re.
If the dat. be read, we shall trans-
late as above, if the abl.‚ we must
make paratum mean ‘ gained by a
deed,’ etc.

3 Scribonianum] We have not
Tacitus’s account of his rebellion,
though it is alluded to ini. 89. 2,
Ann. xii. 52. 1. As told by extant
authorities, it appears that his failure
was rather due to the reluctance of
his men generally to follow him,
than to the treachery of one.

innam] ‘ Set in motion ’ by a
sudden appoel : see on i. 5. 1.
