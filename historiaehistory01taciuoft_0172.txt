TACITI HISTORIARUM 1. 90.

Vitellium abstinuit, quando, ut in consiliis militiae Suetonio
Paulino et Mario Cels0, ita in rebus urbanis ¹Galerii Trachali
ingenio Othonem uti credebatur. Et erant qui genus‘ipsum 3
orandi noscerent, crebro fori usu celebre et ad implendas

populi aures latum et sonans.

aut imperatorem Augustum' prosequerentur, ita' studiis votisque
certabant, nec metu aut amore, sed ex libidine servitii, ut in
familiis, privata cuique stimulatio et vile jam decus publicum.
Profectus Otho quietem urbis curasque imperii Salvio Titiano 5

fratri permisit.

2 ut..1ta] The point of
the comparison is probably a half-
sarcastic apology3 no one blames
an emperor for employing better
soldiers than himself to command
his armies, so why should we blame
him for getting a better orator to
compose his speeches? For the
Graecism of Othonem uti instead of
Otho . . . credebatur, cf. on 50. 1.

3 latum] Either ‘copious, fluent,'
as a characteristic of his style, or
‘far-reaching’ of his voice ; on the
latter view, it would give, not the
point in which Otho's speeches
resembled his, but the cause that
made his widely known, so as
readily to be compared with Otho's.
Either way Tacitus does not mean
the word for very high praise, but
agrees with Quintilian, who ascribes
to him ahigh degree of external merit.

4 dictatorem . . . imperatorem]

ῌῗ gives to each his highest military
tit e.

ut in tamma] Having the ap-
petites characteristic of the servile
state, they behaved just as domestic
slaves do, i. e. aped, and thereby
encouraged their masters from
vanity and sels· interest, where under
no actual constraint. The compari-
son suggests that Roman slavery in
this age was less rigorous than is
generally supposed.

stimulatio] The word is silver-
age; it does not seem to give a
materially different sense from what
stimulus would. Of course in Eng-
lish we should use a verbal subst.,
‘ excitement,' or the like3 but in
Latin abstract and concrete verbals
are kept more distinct.

5 Profectus] On the 24th of

March, a wild and moumful festival
of Cybele.
