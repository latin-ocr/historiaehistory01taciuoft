stronger.’ Proximos must mean
Gaul and Spain, not the Vitellian
party generally, or it would have to
be comparative, like validiores.

. 5 praetexto] We had praetextu

i. e. competing with the recognised
governing order.

pleraque] Most of the customary
rejoicings at an accession were
celebrated spontaneously; those
that cost money were provided at
Crescens' expense3 then Aproni-

for here, and in iii. 80. 2, the sense
seems to be‘ under the flzir show‚'

rather than‘ under the fezgned show!
But the neuter form is in these
passages presented by Μ, and is
also used by Seneca.

prior audltus] ‘ The (candidate)
first heard of ς’ a participle, not a
verbal substantive.

did not care to change it.

CH. LXXVII. 1 distractis] In
the most literal sense, ‘drawn to one
or other of the opposite sides!
After exercitibus there are traces of
a sll÷ort word lost;

2 menses] Julius Caesar had
introduced this custom of appointing
pairs of consuls? or less than a
twelvemonth ; see iii. 37 fin.

3 Viennensium] Who might else
be irritated by a compliment to
