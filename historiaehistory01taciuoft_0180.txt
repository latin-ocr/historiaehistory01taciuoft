CORNELII TACITI

Non fallebat duces impetus militum: sed bellantibus

aliis placuit exspectari belli exitum. Victores victosque

nunquam solida fide coalescere.

N ec referre, Vitellium an 2

Othonem superstitem fortuna faceret. Rebus secundis etiam
egregios duces insolescere: discordiam his, ignaviam, luxuriem 3
et suismet vitiis alterum bello, alterum victoria periturum.
Igitur arma in occasionem distulere, Vespasianus Mucianusque 3
nuper, ceteri olim mixtis consiliis; optimus quisque amore
rei publicae: multos dulcedo praedarum stimulabat, alios

ambiguae domi res,

Ita boni malique causis diversiS, studio 4
pari, bellum omnes cupiebant.

8 Sub idem tempus Achaia atque Asia falso exterritae velut
Nero adventaret, vario super exitu ejus rumore, eoque pluribus

vivere eum fingentibus credentibusque.

Ceterorum ⁸· casus

conatusque in contextu operis dicemus: tunc servus e Ponto
sive, ut alii tradidere, libertinus ex Italia, citharae et cantus
peritus, (unde illi super similitudinem oris propior ad fallendum
fides,) adjunctis desertoribus quos inopia vagos ingentibus
promissis corruperat, mare ingreditur3 ac, vi tempestatum
Cythnum insulam detrusus, et militum quosdam ex Oriente

. Asia, etc. 3 or one ngrkt from placuit for this and the sub-

translate, ‘ The islands lying in the
sea at once gave them conveniences
for preparing the war meanwhile‚’
because it facilitated their communi-
cation with Italy to have ports to
touch at half way, ‘and the sea
itself was a source of safety ' because
the powers supreme in Italy had no
fleet, except that operating on the
Gaulish coast. This explanation
supposes et to be unsymmetrically
placed, but gives the best force to
the position of ipfflm mare.

CH. VII. 1 coalescere] A gene-
ral maxim—not that the conquerors
and conquered in this case never
- would, but that conquerors and con-
quered never do. It is idle to
speculate what verb is to be supplied

sequent infinitives to depend on.

2 Nec referre] As Otho's devoted
troops fought zealously for Vespa-
sian‚ Tacitus is careful to wam us
not to suppose that Vespasian had
ever given a loyal adhesion to Otho.

3 vesp. . . . consiliis] ‘Vespa-
sian and Mucianus having taken
counsel in common lately (since
Titus reconciled thern), and the rest
(their respective adherents) having
done so long before.' ·

4 bellum omnes] Balances rhe-
torically‚ though not grammatically‚
causis diversis, studio pari .·—they·
had different motives‚ equal zeal‚
and, the same practical end.
