INTRODUCTION. lxiii

emphatic words on which he desires to concentrate our
attention.

He omits the verb substantive very osten, especially aster
Ι inde and other words expressing origin. In some casea of
course, it is omitted in all writers, at least in the indicative3
but he omits it even in the subjunctive, if there is another verb
co·ordinate with it in the sentence, from which it can be sup-
plied in the proper mood and tense. (This even Sallust, the
most like Tacitus of early writers in his grammatical wilsulneSS,

. never ventures on.) He omits it in the infinitive constantly—

even where it is fore not esse that must be supplied. (This
last is quite peculiar to him.)

He omits verba sentiendi et dicendi, even in the Dialogue.
Characteristic of him, though not peculiar to him, is the habit
of gradually sliding into oratio obliqua, so that the historian‚ from
speaking in his own person, passes into a record of the senti·
ments of others—of others perhaps not named nor defined.

He uses the genitive of quality unusually often without a
substantive for it to depend on.

He often omits eo, tante, potius, in comparisonS.

Asyndeton is characteristic of him ς so, on the other hand, is
the emphatic use of a single conjunction at the beginning of a
sentence. The word ceterum in particular has with him a pecu-
liarly pregnant force, almost = re vera autem,· perhaps arising
naturally from its original or at least etymological one, ‘ at all
eventS,’ but only found in TacituS, and once in Suetonius
(Vit. 2, sed quod discrepat, sit in medio. Ceterum, etc.). In
general, it may be said that his use of conjunctions is peculiar.

From these suggestive transitionS, we corne naturally to the
class of sentences which are rather compressed than elliptical.
Tacitus does compress his sentences by all means in his
power, but, as compression is a characteristic of all vigorous
Latin, fewer of his methods for it are individually charac-
