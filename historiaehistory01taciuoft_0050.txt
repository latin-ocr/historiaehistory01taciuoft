xliv INTRODUCTION.

Flavius Clemens1 refused to perform the religious ceremonies
which fell to his lot as consul, he really committed a serious
crime on Roman principles, or on any except his own3 it
scarcely needed a fanatical zeal like Domitian's for the honour
of Juppiter Capitolinus, who had saved both their lives in the
Civil War, to think that he was justly punished with death,
and his wife, and other adherents of so disloyal a sect, with
banishment. This is not unlikely to have been Tacitus' view 3
it is certainly remarkable that in the Agricola he nowhere
mentions Clemens among the victims of Domitian's cruelty,
though in a sense he was the most illustrious of them.²

¹ Dio does not distinguish between Judaism and Christianity in his
account of the persecution; he couples together the charges of Ἰουδαϊκὸς
βίος, ἀθεότης, and ἀσέβεια, as if they were the same thing in Domitian’s
eyes. Juv. xiv. 96 sqq. shows that Judaism did still make converts at
Rome ; but it would have been strange for a Flavius to be among them,
and the traditional view, that Clemens was a Christian, appears to be con·
firmed by nearly contemporary inscriptions. Canon Lightfoot conjectures
that the now more famous St. Clement the Bishop was a freedman of this
St. Clement the Martyr ς but this seems a strange way of accounting for his
bearing the same cognomen. We should think it very strange if, a genera·
tion earlier, any of ‘ the saints of Caesar's household' had been called Caesar,
or even Nero or Drusus. Clemens is a slave’s name in A nn. ii. 39, sq. Dr.
Lightfoot himself quotes an inscription showing that it was borne by a Jewish
slave, such as St. Clement had probably been ς when emancipated, his old
slave's name would serve for a cognomen (Pers. v. 79). The fact is, the name
was very common among all classes, and we cannot (without such evidence
as iv. 68. 3 gives us) presume a relationship between those who bore it.
If we do hazard aguess who St. Clement of Rome was, he is as likely as
anything to have been a son of St. Paul's fellow-labourer, St. Clement of
Philippi, with whom uncritical tradition identifies him. On the other
hand, T. Flavius Clemens, Bishop of Alexandria, about a century later,
may have been descended from the martyr himself, but far more probably
from some one to whom Vespasian had granted citizenship while in the
East ε Flavius in Palestine and Egypt was a name no more distinctive than
Julius or Claudius in Gaul. καὶ περὶ μὲν τούτων τοσαῦτα ἡμῖν εἰποῦσι, καὶ
παρὰ τῶν ἐπισκόπων καὶ παρὰ τῶν μαρτύρων εὐμενείη εἴη.

² His two sons were adopted, or at least openly acknowledged as his
heirs‚ by the Emperor ; Clemens himself was probably older than his
cousin, and so not to be expected to survive him. Of course, in the los't
