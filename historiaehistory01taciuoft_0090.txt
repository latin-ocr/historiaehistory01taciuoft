instead of an accus. depending on

premunt heightens the effect of

the words coming before the
verb, and marks the statement as
general, not confined to the indi-
vidual case.

4 subitis] Commonly taken as a
dat. with avidae, ‘greedyfim' But
that construction is unique. Church
and Brodribb try to give it a
distinctive force, ‘ caught with greedy
but
perhaps it is simpler to make it an
abl., ‘ their cupidity aroused by the
sudden change.’

eademque . . .
the evils of the new court identical
with those of the old, were equally
felt as burdens, and found less ready
excuse.' Aeque gravia is not a
mere repetition of eadem. VVhether
in construction it is a predicate
co-ordinate with non aeque excusata,
or agrees directly with the subject,
‘ though equally felt,' the Latin form
of predication dispensed Tacitus
from deciding.

CH. VIII. 1 tanquam . . . mul-
tuumne] Best taken, with Church
and Brodribb, ‘ as far as one can
speak of so vast amultitude.' Tan-

excusata] ‘ And

quam in might naturally mean ‘ as
was natural in‚' but laic can hardly
be got to mean ‘ so various,' which
is the only sense that the mention of
the multitude could account for.

2 facundus et pacis ambus] For
the coupling of an adj. with an abl.
of quality, cf. Virg. Aen. vi. 640-1‚
‘ largior lzos campos aether et lumine
vestit Purpure0.’

inexpertus] Rather ‘ untried in’
than ‘ without experience of ; ’ the
latter would less naturally take the
abl.

3 recenti dono] The chiess had
received full citizenship from Claudius
in his censorship, A. D. 48, Ann. xi.
23. 1.

4 pari . . .
sense is pregnant: ‘measured the
wrong done to them by the good
bestowed on others, so that they
were as much distressed by the
latter as by the former.'

5 periculosissimum] The ex-
treme danger is, for so powerful a
force to have their anger and their
dread aroused; not the particular
causes that had aroused theirs‚
though these may have made the
danger still greater.

metiebantur] The
