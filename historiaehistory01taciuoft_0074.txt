lxviii INTRODUCTION.

An inversion more characteristic of Tacitus is the placing
tz'tles before names.

Remarkable in Tacitus, though not peculiar to him, is the
habit of separating‚ by one or more wordS‚ two words closely
united in construction. This becomes more and more frequent
from the time of Cicero onwards. One instance to which
these remarks especially apply is the insertion of epse between
the two agreeing words of an ablative absolute.

The anastrophe of a preposition is more or less characteristic
of Tacitus. His placing a preposition after two cases depend-
ing on it is absolutely peculiar to him3 putting it between the
two is nearly so 3 putting it after a single case is of course not
unknown elsewhere, though more frequent with him than any
one. He often inserts the preposition between the substantive
and adjective, which is elsewhere mostly poetical; and heis
the only prose author who inserts it between substantives in
apposition.

There are instanceS, less easy to classify, of similar ana—
strophe of conjunctions.

The text of this edition is Orelli's. On a comparison of those
that have appeared since his, I feel as if more scholarly in-
genuity than soundness of judgment had been employed on its
emendation. Ritter's collatz'on of the chief Mss. (M and Ma),
is preferred to Baiter’s, which Orelli used ; but the text of
Ritter’s (nearly contemporary) edition seems far less judicious
than Orelli’s. The truth is, that so far as Tacitus' text has
been preserved at all, it has been preserved in a very satisfac-
tory condition 3 just because there never were many copies of
him, the few copies we have have come to us through few
hands, There are comparatively few passages where critical
sagacity is called for at all, except in the two places wherera
pair of leaves has been lost from our archetypal MS. (that here
