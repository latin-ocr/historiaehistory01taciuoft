5 transitus rerum] The last
sentence explains what he means:
power was passing from Galba, and
had not et passed to Piso.

next sentence shows it is not alto-
gether an irony.

CH. XXII. 1 adulteria, matri-
monia] With unlimited facilities
of divorce, the latter differed from
the former only in duration. So
Cicero reckons Clodius's wife among
his usual discreditable companions,
Mil. x. 28.

regnorum] If these were the
attractions of empire‚ the empire

name, ii. 78. 2.

ut. . . adscisceretur] That he
would be peaceably adopted as his
colleague and successor. Tacitus half
