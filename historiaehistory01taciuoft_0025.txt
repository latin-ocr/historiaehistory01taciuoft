 

INTRODUCTION. xix

Tacitus' absence from Rome does not seem to have lasted
long after this time. It is possible that after his provincial
government expired, he found opportunity for an antiquarian
tour in the East 3 such a prolongation of his absence would
suit what seems to have been his view of the part of a wise
man, to ‘keep silence in the evil time,' and avoid being
either the instrument or the victim of a tyrant. It is implied
also, in Agr. 3. 4, that he had written, or at least planned, the
Htkton‘es before the revolution which made it safe to publish
them, and their composition may have been as easy and more

suggestS, from letters and from the public gazetteS. We have
to decide whether it is less likely that in c. 45 Tacitus
identifies himself entirely with his order, and holds himself
responsible for what they did in his absence, or that in e. 2
he identifies himself with his readem, and affects to share
their remoteness from what he must have known personally.
However this question may be decided, it may be taken
for granted that Tacitus neither sacrificed his sels-respect to
Domitian, nor risked his life by opposing him, as his friend
Pliny (Ep. vii. 33) was proud of having done. But, like
every one throughout the Empire, he felt Domitian's death
and the accession of Nerva as a relies ς in truth, he belonged
to the class that had most to gain by it. When he con·
