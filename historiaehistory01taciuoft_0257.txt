apud Vespasianum fore pacta transitionis. Simul odiorum 5
invidiaeque erga Fabium Valentem admonebatur, ut inpar
apud Vitellium, gratiam viresque apud novum principem
pararet.

partem equitum ad occupandam Cremonam praemisit. Mox

et prima Italica incessere, cum vexillariis trium Britannicarum
legionum et electis auxiliis. Profecto Caecina scripsit Fabius 2
Valens exercitui quem ipse ductaverat, ut in itinere opperiretur:
sic sibi cum Caecina convenisse 3 qui praesenS‚ eoque validior,
immutatum id consilium finxit, ut ingruenti bello tota mole

cn. C. 1 e complexu v.] His
unsuspiciousness is dwelt on, as
aggravating Caecina's treason ; but
perhaps it is also meant to indicate
a maudlin effusiveness on his part.

vexilla . . . legionum] So Μ.,
and Or. prints it as it stands, not
being satisfied with any of the
corrections proposed. From iii.
22. 2, it appears that the legions
which marched with Caecina were
(besides the 5th, 22d‚ 21st‚ and 1st
Italian, and the vexilla of the 9th,
2d, and 20th), the 4th, 15th‚ 16th,
and 1st (Germanica). The names
of some or all of these no doubt
occurred here ; very likely vexilla is
corrupt, as well as the following
words, since the whole of these
eight legions seem to have been

present. Perhaps the source of the
corruption is from a scribe having
found the passage written in figures,
and not known whether to express
them by oerdinal or ordinal num·
bers.

manently) commander os.’ This
force, that of Lower Germany, in·
cluded (i. 55. 2) the rst, 5th‚ 15th,
and 16th legions.

3] He first goes to Ravenna, and
makes a speech to the troops
belonging to the fleet: picks up
Bassus (which perhaps was his
sole design in going there), takes
him to Patavium, apart from his own
men, and arranges there sor the
betrayal of both fleet and army.
