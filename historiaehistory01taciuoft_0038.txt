xxxii INTRODUCTION.

confidently that even his habitual tone of mind was the same
through life. The young, cheerful, and hopeful rhetorieian
whom we make acquaintance with in the Dialogue is a differ-
ent character from the grave disappointed man of forty-five
who speaks in the first paragraphs of the Agricola ,· and as the
ffi'stories and Germany rapidly follow, we still trace a severe
and gloomy theory of life—the world is a bad place, and un-
redeemed from evil, though many even of its evils serve to
supply an intellectual interest that commands both happiness
and respect, and though prosperity and security make self-
respect easy, and sels-respect makes life endurable even in
this evil world. On the other hand, twenty years of this pro-
sperity, security, and sels-respect, twenty years' contemplation
of the good government that afforded them, was not without

ffiktom‘es; the period recorded excites the author's indignation
more, and he naturally treats it with more bitterness. But it
is a question if this bitterness came from very deep in his
heart. A pessimist temper, once formed, is not likely to be
thrown off in old age, but it ceases to imbitter the life or the
character, when pessimism is thrown back upon the past,
and its inquiry is, wh'y the former days were not better than
these, but on the contrary a great deal worse. The author
of the Amzals is aware that he is living in a silver age3 he
doubts if there ever was a golden. He proves that it was not
at any time since the reign of Augustus, scarcely in it 3 he
does not deny that there was a heroic age, to say the least,
in the days of the Republic‚ but he seems to feel that the
glory of its heroes is safest when enshrined in myth or haloed
with the mistos time. If he writes more like a Republican
than he had twenty years earlier, it is only as Scott wrote
more like a Jacobite than Johnson, and Aytoun more than
