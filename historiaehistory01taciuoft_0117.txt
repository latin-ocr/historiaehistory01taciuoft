HISTORIARUM Ι. 35. 39

quidam et vidisse adfirmabant, credula fama inter gaudentes
et incuriosos, Multi arbitrabantur compositum auctumque 3
rumorem mixtis jam Othonianis, qui ad evocandum Galbam 421. A
35 laeta falso volgaverint. Tum vero non populus tantum et '
imperita plebs in plausus et inmodica studia, sed equitum
plerique ac senatorum, posito metu incauti, refractis Palatii
foribus ruere intus ac se Galbae ostentare, praereptam sibi
ultionem querentes, Ignavissimus quisque, et, ut res docuit, 2
in periculo non ausurus, nimii verbis, linguae seroces, nemo
scire, et omnes adfirmare, donec inopia veri, et consensu
errantium victuS, sumpto thorace Galba, inruenti turbae neque
aetate neque corpore sistenS, sella levaretur. Obvius in 3
Palatio Julius Atticus speculator, cruentum gladium ostentans,
occisum a se Othonem exclamavit; et Galba, ‘Commilit0,'

, bant, their belief readily followed

their wish3 or perhaps better, ‘and
1 find it easier to believe in his
hatred.’ The latter gives a better
force to the comparative. More-
over, Vinius had opposed Piso’ s
adoption.

maula] There seems no instance
os this word meaning ‘easy of belies'
in a passive sense, as Ernesti took
it, it must be a sort of half per—
sonification of Rumour.

menno-os] ‘Uncritical’ rather
than‘ indifferent)

gemmatum auctumque ‘That
it wasgotu on purpose, an spread
more widy because Otho’ s men
(from the camp) had by this time
mixed in the crowd; its original
authors were not Othoniani in the
sense of being in his conspiracy,

though they raised the report in his
interest.

CH. XXXV. 1 populus . . .
mens] Praetically synonymous,
only the latter a shade more con-
temptuous: so the two words are
coupled at 36. 23 40. 23 72. 3.

ln . . . studia] With ruere,

though the verb when it comes has
a construction os its own with intus,

in the literal sense of physioel
motion.

2 feroces is no doubt the con·
struction: M. has serocezr, but the

ψ general usage of this MS. is not to

spell the nom. pl. with an i, so this
{iffizssbssfflessffbsszz ἳεξξῖοἰὲῗξῐὲ
and less symmetrical.

thorace] A linen one, according
to Suetonius, was all he could stand,
and he mdzes Galba say it would
be little use; but Tacitus implies
that it was sword-proos, 41. 7.

sistens] Never elsewhere with
the dative: it must mean like re
sistens, ‘standing against) Either
Tacitus wrote tens and
one re dropped out, or he wrote as
in the text to avoid the cacophony
re re.

3 speculator] He had, or pre-
tended to have, gone to the camp
and back since Piso's speech. The
speculatores were attached to Otho's
interest (see on 31. 1), but his boast

was perhaps principally in his own.
