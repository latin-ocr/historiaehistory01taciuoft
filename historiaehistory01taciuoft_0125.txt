2 non musione . . . sed latebra]
He does not mean to blame Piso
for hiding, but says that the soldiers
would not have respected the
sanctuary. Protractus, however,
implies (as in several Greek in-
stannes) a sort of inconsistent dread
of polluting it by blood.
nominatim . . . ardentes] Eager
to kin Piso in particular, he being

’ named in Otho s charge to them;

though sometimes taken ‘ expressly
named because eager to kill him.'
CH. XLIV. 1 imagine tristi
contuderat] The tense implies
merely that he had seen their heads
before Piso's; the words probably
mean no more than that he had been
shocked at the sight, though some

refer to a story in Dio, that Otho
in his turn had bad omens in
sacrifice, and seemed the night
aster to have had a terrible droem.
inimici et aemuli] The first
word pointing the contrast with
Vinius, the second with Galba.

2 stgna . . . aqmlam] Simi-
larly distinguished in ii. 43. 2,
111. 22. 5.

ostentantibus . . . jactabant]
‘ Those who had killed them, those
who had been present ' (near enough
perhaps to dip their hands in blood
on purpose), ‘or who, whether
truly or falsely, boasted of either,
showing‚' etc. Ritter says that
only the actual slayers would be
able to show bloody hands,-which
nevertheless the pretended slayer of
Otho had managed to d0‚—so he
puts a stop after manus, and takes
