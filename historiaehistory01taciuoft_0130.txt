Caput 2

per lixas calonesque suffixum laceratumque, ante Patrobii
tumulum (libertus is Neronis punitus a Galba fuerat,) postera
demum die repertum et cremato jam corpori admixtum est.
Hunc exitum habuit Servius Galba, tribus et septuaginta annis 3
quinque principes prospera fortuna emensus, et alieno imperio

fathers, apart from such special
favour as he got from Galba.
tamquam] This, and perhaps the
reus arguebatur in the last sec„ seem
meant to avoid committing the
writer to the direct statement of
his guilt3 while yet he evidently
thinks the suspicion in both cases
strong enough to discredit him.

8 Testamentum . . . supremam
voluntatem] Vinius's legal ‘will '
is distinguished from Piso's ‘last
wishes,' rather because it was a more
extensive document, disposing of a
larger property, than because the
latter was not drawn up in legal
form. From the business-like habits
of Roman nobles, it probably was
so, in spite of Piso's youth3 and it
is hardly likely that he can have
sent a message home while in
hidin .

CHg XLIX. 1 e prioribus servis]
‘ Quos ante principatum habuerat,'
Or. One might add, whom he had
emancipated before his accession.
An imperial freedman like Icelus

was the worst sort of courtier ;ι the
confidential freedman of a respect-
able noble was the best sort of
retainer.

2 per lixas] Not a lz'ler ; they
are conceived as mere instruments
of the murderers, who left the
head to them.

admixtum] Being no doubt
itself burm, the ashes would liter·
ally mingle.

3 Hunc entQ] Notice, as a
feature in the history of thought,
that the biographies of Piso, Vinius,
and Galba end, not with the death
of each, but with his burial.

tribus et septu] Nero had been
warned‚ it was said, by an oracle
to beware of the seventy-third year.
He supposed that he was to die at
73, but was overthrown at 31 by a
man of 73,—in what ought to be
called A. D. 7 3, if the vana mirantes
(Anu. i. 9. 1) want a further coin-
cidence.

quinque principes] As we should
say, ‘five reigns 3' see on 1. 1.
