l INTRODUCTION.

to have taken place 3 while there is no reason whatever for set-
ting aside the Ms. evidence that Tacitus was the author, except
the unlikeness of style to his later works, which itself is
neutralised by subtle underlying resemblances. But we can-
not doubt, from the place of the letters in Pliny's collection,
that he is one party to the correspondence—scarcely, that
Tacitus is the other 3 it therefore follows, that Tacitus' title to
the authorship of the Dialogue is confirmed, but burdened with
a title to the authorship of the literary boat-hunt. It may be
added, that Tacitus, being the older of the two, had better
reason for the apprehension, with which the letter opens, that
his friend would laugh at the idea of his turning huntsman.

Nearly every editor of Pliny or of Tacitus has formed a
different opinion as to the explanation of the phenomena of
these two letters. For the reasons above stated, I confess
that Ι come reluctantly to the conclusion, that Tacitus must
bear the blame of having written the priggish one. If s0‚ the
only excuse to be advanced for him is, that in letter-writing
you must adapt your tone to the character and humour of
your correspondent.
