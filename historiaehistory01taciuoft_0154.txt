76 CORNELII TACITI

arma Clodium Macrum, famem populo Romano haud obscure

Ἕῖἶῖῖᾶ, totius postea civitatis gratiam obtinuit, consulari
matrimonio subnixa et apud Galbam Othonem Vitellium
illaesa, mox potens pecunia et orbitate, quae bonis malisque
temporibus juxta valent.

74 Crebrae interim, et muliebribus blandimentis infectae, ab
Othone ad Vitellium epistolae offerebant pecuniam et gratiam
et quemcunque quietis locum prodigae vitae legisset. Paria 2
Vitellius ostentabat, primo mollius, stulta utrinque et indecora
simulatione: mox, quasi rixantes, stupra et flagitia in vicem
objectavere, neuter falso. Otho, revocatis quos Galba 3
miserat legatiS, rursus alios ad utrumque Germanicum ex-
ercitum et ad legionem Italicam easque quae Lugduni
agebant copias specie senatus misit. Legati apud Vitellium 4
remansere, promptius quam ut rektenti viderentur. Praetoriani‚
quos per simulationem officii legatis Otho adjunxerat, remissi
antequam legionibus miscerentur. Addidit epistolas Fabius 5

managed and arranged the require·
ments of his profligate taste. The
title is a less euphemistic feminine
for that of Petronius, arbiter
elegantiarum. It does not mean
that she was Nero’s ‘ mistress.’

clodium Macrum] Sup. 7. 1.

bonis . . . temporibus] Under
Vespasian, for she can hardly have
lived to the times of Nerva or
Trajan.

CH. LXXIV. 1] According to
Suetonius and Dio, he even offered
him a share in the empire, and-—
what may more easily be believed
—proposed to marry his daughter 3
he was still caelebs (13. 5), and she
can hardly yet have married Asiati·
cus (59- 4)· ,

2 neuter falso] The stor1es
against Vitellius were however old, ·
he was by this time past giving
scandal, however contemptible, ii.

31. 1.

3 {¹2⁰⁸ Galba mserat] Sup.
19. 4 .

specie] More ironical than nom·
ine, ‘ under colour of being the
Senate’s delegates,' not Otho's per·
sonally. The point is, that Vitel-
lius is called on to submit, not
to Otho, a rival claimant of sover-
eignty on equal terms with himself,
but to the Senate‚ whose unques-
tioned right it was to exercise‚
or at least to assign, the sover-
eignty.

4 per simulationem offlofl]
‘ Under pretence of compliment,'
really to prevent their deserting as
they actually did. They pretended
not to be able to trust their escort,
if admitted to intercourse with the
enemy's troops, really the escort
was, as Otho knew, more trust-
w orthy than they.

remissi] Probably by Vitellius,
not by the legates.
