the facts so well.

6 vertimus] Does Tacitus mean,
by the emphatic osition of the
name, to hint that t e soldiers took
up the cause of Galba before their
commander? It was believed that
the collision with Vindex’s army was
occidental, or due to the soldiers
being still attached to Nero, the
generals having agreed between
themselves to co-operate. Yet Ver-
ginius in his own epitaph seems to
claim credit for the defeat of Vindex
as one of his acts of loyalty, no less
than the refusal to use the victory
for selfish ends—

'Hic situs est Rufus, puLvo qui Vindice
quondam,
Imperium assernit non sibi sedpatriae!

8 reum esse] Tacitus does not
mean that he was in serious danger
of a criminal charge, only that he
was treated as ‘ suspect.'

accinebant] Apparently in a

double sense, ‘heard of ' the fact,
and ‘took it' as a blame to them·
selves.

suum mmm] As though they
themselves were included in the
charge against him.

CH. IX. 1 mmmm] For the
concrete use, cf Liv. iv. 31, where
regimen rerum . . . peteretur: ‘ a
commander be selected.·

adeo] Common enough, though
only post-Augustan, aster either

sense of ‘ much less‘ or ‘ much
more 3' here it becomes almost

peaceable troops, now, when their
passions were roused, the weakness
of the man whose duty it was to
restrain them inflamed them all
the more.'

2 id saus videbatur] Vitellius
was a poor enough consular himself
(he had been consul in Α. D. 48, the
year of his father’s censorship, iii.
86. 1, Ann. xi. 23. 1), but his
father’s distinction made it seem
that he would do.
