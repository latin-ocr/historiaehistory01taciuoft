partial, as Ι shall of course not give
way to affection, so Ι must speak
without hatred,' which he might
more easily be suspected of. But
here the form of the antithesis pro·
duces a little confusion3 for one
could not say sine odio quisquam
dicendus est: some distributive pro-
nloun must be supplied in the second
c ause.

5] Tacitus seems, when he began
the Annales ab excessu divi Augusti,
to have abandoned this project‚—not
simply deferred it, as in Ann. iii.
24. 4 he contemplates writing, ‘if
his life lasted long enough‚' a
history of the reign, not of Trajan,
but of Augustus.

principatum . . . imperium]
The civil and military sides of the
imperial power, thus naturally as-
cribed to the man of peace and the
conqueror res ectively.

securiorem 5‘ ‘Less anxious, ’less
gdiilifflets} liizlet13mtdatgeive 3ὲὲῐέηὲὲο
but Tacitus does not affect to think
his plain speaking about the past
dangerous; he only means, ‘I shall
not be afraid to write Trajan' s life
while Trajan lives, as Ι should have
been to write Dorriitian' s.'

CH. II. 1] ‘The work Ι prepare
to encounter is one rich m strokes
of fate, hideous with battle, dis-
tracted with sedition)

Quattuor principes] Galba, Otho,

and Vitellius are plainly three 3 the

fourth must be Domitian, not Nero.
Not only have we external evidence
(rather provoking, but undeniable;
see Preface) that Domitian's death

was included in the work3 in this -

c. events of his reign are plainly
spoken of, and at what point before
his death could the book have ended?
Trina bella civilia] There was
none at the death of Galba, but
there was one between Otho and
Vitellius, one between Vitellius and
Vespasian. The third must appar-
ently be the revolt of Saturninus
against Domitian; though there had
been between Vindex and the troops
still adhering to Nero what is cer-
tainly called a civil war, in ii. 6. 3,
and deserves the title perhaps better
than the latter, yet it cannot, any
more than Nero's death, be said to
be comprised in this work. The
only mention made of either that is
more than an allusion is in c. 4,
and this is expressly announced as
coming before the author sets in
order the work of his main purpose.
2 plerumque permixta] ‘ And
the two generally united,' as when
Civilis professed to be fighting for
Vespasian. Antonius Saturninus also
had engaged German auxiliaries.
Prosperae . . . res] Judaea
was thoroughly conquered‚ and the
threats from Parthia came to
nothing, while* Gaul revolted and
Germany became dangerous.
3 perdomita] By Agricola.
