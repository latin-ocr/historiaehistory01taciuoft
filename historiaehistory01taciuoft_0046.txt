pected of having a hand in its dissolution. The case of Cato
against the philosophers was essentially the same as that of
Aristophanes against the sophists: moral habits are, in the
individual and in the nation‚ earlier than reason, and ought
to be stronger‚ and those who undertake to rest them upon
reason, and judge them by reason, are exposed to the tempta-

as far from being able to answer the questions V they asked
in the second century before Christ as in the fifth, and so far
the prejudice against them was less reasonable 3 on the other
hand, they were not only innovators but foreigners, and on

‘ philosophari, sed paucis, nam omnino haud placet,'

not merely because the active life was held to be higher than

sophical questions, or adopted philosophical discipline, with a
zeal which was its own end, and not subordinated to practice.
Yet he seems to admire Helvidius PriscuS, who studied philo-
