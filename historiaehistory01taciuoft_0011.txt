I.—LIFE AND TIMES OF TACITUS.

,γὲ THE great historian of the second century of the Roman
’ Empire can hardly be considered one of the authors
whose personality has disappeared from the range os know·
ledge, and whose names serve only as titles sor their writingS.
’ On the other hand, we have not sufficient materials for a con·

> his descent‚ parentage‚ birthplace‚ and even his personal

 

name, are all uncertain, though, as to these, we have more
’ or less substantial materials sor conjecture.

That kindly, piouS, versatile man of letters and affairs, St.
Ι Sidonius Apollinaris, in one of his Epistles quotes from ‘C.
Comelius,' and in another from· ‘ C. Tacitus' (i. 14 ἐπεὶ, i. 22).
It is therefore plain that in the belief of a well-read man of the
ξ fisth century, the historian bore the praenomen Gaius ; and

that it is contradicted by another respectable authority, the
first Medicean MS„ which calls him Publius in the subscription
to each of the first three books, as well as in the title, which
Ritter ascribed to a later hand. Nipperdey considers the
latter authority the higher 3 but it is hard to guess what should
have led Sidonius wrong, while Ritter suggests that a scribe
who knew history was used to the combination P. Cornelius.

Most recent editors, including Nipperdey himself, think it
