i. e. they were cancelled by Vitellius
almost as soon as the news came
of their being promised by Otho.

2] We have passed gradually to
pleraque contra decus. Tacitus
began with the honourable routine
of public business, then passed to
excusable measures of policy‚ and
then to thoroughly indecent acts of
indulgence to passion—Otho's own
or the people's.

ne tum quidem] The crisis,
which gave the excuse of policy to
some questionable acts, ought to
have driven out of his head any qu es-
tionable act that was not even politic.

3 proponerent] Set up in public
places—it does not appear whether
new ones or old ones brought out
of hiding.

Neroni Othoni] It seems from
Plutarch, that the title was so far
officially adopted as to be used in
despatches sent to Spain—possibly

we are to understand that Rufus
made it the pretext of his revolt.
One should remember, that Otho
was just as much a Nero as he was
a Caesar—the object may have been
to connect himself with the dynasty
as much as with the individual.

4 vel] Tacitus suggests two
possible motives for his indecision:
either (wishing to reject) he was
afraid to reject, or (wishing to
accept) he was ashamed to accept.

CH. LXXIX. 1 sine cura habe-
bantur] Probably, ‘were considered
to be free from anxiety.' One could
scarcely say sine cura habere in the
sense of ‘to treat or regard care-
lessly.’ Yet this might perhaps be
excused by the use of certain other
prepositions with habeo, eng. pro

certo habere, and still more aliquem ’

in metu habere.
ad Moesiam inruperant] ‘ Had

implied a longer successful advance.
