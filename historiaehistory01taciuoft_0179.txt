Occidentis coepta; et Pompeio, Cassio, Brute, Antonio, quos

Parthos minae, vario eventu. Et proximo civili bello turbatis
aliis inconcussa ibi pax 3 dein fides erga Galbam. Mox, ut 4
Othonem ac Vitellium scelestis armis res Romanas raptum

tantum . . . minae] Contrasted

with the serious operations in
Germany and Britain. Yet Cor-
bulo’s campaigns were serious

longa eoncordia . . . primum

under Galba, the German armies

under Vitellius, perhaps even Macer
in Africa (i. 7. 1) had done the
same ε but for an eastern precedent,
one had to go back to Antony,
before the longa concordia. Then
in the next sentence he says, ‘ If you
do go back so far, you find excep-
tions which prove the rule.' Going
still further back, however, one
might quote Sulla as starting from
the east to make himself master of
Rome. -

2 auumque . . . inspecti]
Germanicus had died in Syria, and·
no Caesar had been there since.

3 Nulla seditio legionum] As

there had been in the west on . .

Tiberius's accession.

would scarcely apply to the other

the islands which broke the separa·
