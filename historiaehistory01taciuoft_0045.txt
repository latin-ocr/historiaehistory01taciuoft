right ς’ it also is the base of the sense of rectitude and honour
in nobler savages like Simeon and Levi‚¹ and in commonplace
moderns whose intellectual life is narrow.⁸ It is therefore
¹ .' not to be wondered at if we trace its power at an intermediate
Ἴ stage of human history 3 and at Rome its power was excep-
„ tionally prolonged. A law, imposed by a known law-giver,
by obedience to which things may be kept as they are at their
¹ best3 an ideal, better than anything which now visibly existS,
³ to which human life may yet be made to conform ; a tendency
in the world, or in human life, to become better than it has
been, or a power, above man and the world, capable of mak-
, ing it so 3—any of these, when suggested either by independent
thought or by real or supposed revelation, serves to supple·
ment, and in part supersede, the old crude ethics of custom 3
or, again, these may be modified and systematised, by analysis
. and mutual reconciliation of the customary ruleS, until some
principle, like that of general utility, is discovered underlying
them, which gives them, when amended in detail, a speculative
justificatiom or at least a defence from adverse speculation.
All progressive societies, ancient and modern, have learnt to
base their moral code on one or all of these defensible
grounds ς but just because at Rome the traditional morality
ἶ , was so strong, it did not spontaneously seek any external
„ support.⁸ From the days of Cato to those of AugustuS‚
Roman morality was going to piecea and those who were
endeavouring to reconstruct it were, not quite unjustly, sus-
