auxilio, etiarn si provenisset. Vocatis principibus insulae
consilium aperit, et contra dicere auSOS, Claudium Pyrrhicum
trierarchum Liburnicarum ibi navium, Quintium Certum
equitem Romanum, interfici jubet. Quorum morte exterriti 3
qui aderant, simul ignara et alieni metus socia imperitorum
turba, in verba Vitellii juravere. Sed ubi delectum agere 4
Pacarius et inconditos homines fatigare militiae muneribus
occepit, laborem insolitum perosi infirmitatem suam reputabant :
insulam esse quam incolerent, et longe Germaniam viresque
legionum 3 direptos vastatosque classe etiam quos cohortes
alaeque protegerent. Et aversi repente animi3 nec tamen 5
aperta vi, aptum tempus insidiis legere. Digressis qui Pacarium
frequentabant, nudus et auxilii inops balineis interficitur, truci-
dati et comites, Capita, ut hostium, ipsi interfectores ad 6
Othonem tulere3 neque eos aut Otho praemio affecit aut

these local notabilities were, that
Malta maintained only one of thern,
who apparently (fromy his name) had
received Roman citizenship.

of disci line, as well as the know
ledge o drill.

5 nec . . . vl] ‘They did so,
however, not by open force, but '
. . . the abl. abs. is like that in 14.
4, the verb being supplied partly
from aversi and partly from legere.
This seems better than to force the
meaning of aperta, ‘ yet, as there

from comites, his Roman suite.

6 ut nostium] They were treated
as ‘public enemies‚’ i.e. traitors in
arms. One cannot compare 12. 4,

‘for the laws of war would not have

called sor such treatment of a foreign
enemy.

Cn. XVII. 1 Aperuerat] We
have a similar phrase in iii. 2. 9,
reseratam Italiam. Aper-ire is the
common word in this sense; that
in 21. 1 is similar. Both are
held to be extensions of the applica·
tion of the word to a sencer ‘ laying
himself open.'
