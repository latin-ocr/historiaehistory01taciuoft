H1srox1ARUM 11. 4 99

alia laetum antiquitatibus Graecorum genus incertae vetustati
adfingit, de navigatione primum consuluit. Postquam pandi 2
viam et mare prosperum accepit, de se per ambages interrogat

- caesis compluribus hostiis. Sostratus (sacerdotis id nomen 3
erat,) ubi laeta et congruentia exta magnisque consultis adnuere
deam videt, pauca in praesens et solita respondens, petito
secreto futura aperit. Titus aucto animo ad patrem pervectus 4
suspensis provinciarum et exercituum mentibus ingens rerum
fiducia accessit.

Profligaverat bellum Judaicum Vespasianus, obpugnatione 5
Hierosolymorum reliqua, duro magis et arduo opere ob ingen-
ium montis et pervicaciam superstitionis, quam quo satis
virium obsessis ad tolerandas necessitates superesset. TreS, 6
‘ut supra memoravimuS, ipsi Vespasiano legiones erant, exer·
citae bello: quattuor Mucianus obtinebat in pace; sed
aemulatio et proximi exercitus gloria depulerat segnitiam,
quantumque illis roboris discrimina et labor, tantum his vigoris
addiderat integra quies et inexperti belli † labor (amor 17).Α

5 Profligaverat] ‘ Had broken

hewn block 3 it may have been
the strength ofz' this phrase ex·

merely an ornamental obelisk‚ con-

seerated for mere anfiquity, or have
been made a symbol of the goddess
because it was ornamental—-as Ho-
tried to connect it with his
‘ Line of Beauty.’
Cn. IV. 1 quaeque aua . .

amnem] The offerings ascribed. to fic

mythical, as well as historical‚
pilgrims and benefactors.

2 do se] What his final fortunes
were to be—opposed to such par-
ticular inquiries as that about the
voyage.

4 fiducia] In apposition with
Titus, as fides in the next c. ἓ 3.
So in 23. 6, iv. 85. 2, we have
abstract nouns in apposition with
personal names: but the closest
parallel quoted to this expression
is a passage of Justin (xi. 9), ‘qui

. . non mediocre momentum Per-
sarum viribus accessere. ’

hibits a transition between the
etymologioel sense (appffldng in
profligare hostes) and the derived
one of exhausting, almost finishing :
in fact, even with bellum we osten
have profltjgare coupled with con·

ere. .
ingenium] So v. 14. 3, Ann. vi.
41. 1 ; Vir. Georg. ii. 177 issimilar,
though there he probably means to
remind the reader of the common
application of the word to human
nature.

quo] The magis before and the
satis after, give to the particle its
ordinary syntactical force, ‘in pro·
portion as,’ as with a compara-
tive.

6 amor] Suggested by Or.‚ pre—
vious editors having proposed ardor.
Labor is doubtless a careless repeti-
tion from the previous line.
