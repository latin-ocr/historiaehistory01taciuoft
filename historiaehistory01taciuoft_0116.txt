his defensive lines within these
limits, and so lets the enemy come
up to them.

4] If they stayed they would have
to submit to a blockade for which
they had no provisions, and have
only slaves for a garrison, whereas
now they had the crowd, who
were assumed by courtesy to be
citizens.

Vel illustrates well the transition
from the sense ‘or’ to that of ‘even.’

6 invasit] Probably not only
‘assailed him with threats‚' but
walked up to him with threatening
gestures.

stimulante . . . exltlum] In all
likelihood the construction is
‘ Icelus, from his obstinacy in
private hatred, urging him on to
the public ruin.' But it would be
quite possible to take z'n publicum
exitium with pertinacza, ‘from pri-
vate hatred, obstinate till it brought
public ruin, 'as apparently C. and
B.‚ and just possible also to make
Icelo a dative, ‘Laco attacked him,
because Icelu's' 5 obstinacy* 1n private
hatred urged him (Icelus),' etc.

cunctatus] He always yielded to

the pressure of either Vinius or Laco,
and now Vinius was forcibly
silenced. Resides, an appeal to his
honour as a soldier probably had
weight with himself: hence spe-
czoszora, ‘the fairer- -seeming· ·' it
was, or seemed, the more honour-
able course—one could scarcely say
the more prudent. Suetonius knows
nothing of this intended visit to
the camp; of course an intention
never executed is hard to prove or
disprove.

2 recenti favore] It was thought
that the tolerably favourable hearing
they had given Galba (c. 18) was
for Piso’ s sake.

infensus] Rather to be taken
with ut than with quia erat, though
the last comes in less baldly because
the predicate to be supplied is so
near at hand.

irati] ‘ They (perhaps Galba’s
advisers generally, probably those
mentioned, viz. Laco and Icelus) in
their present ill temper. '

et . . . credltm· may mean
that Tacitus leans to either of the
hypotheses he suggests: either ‘ and
belief in hatred is always easier’
than in goodwill‚ so that if ita vole*
