CORNELII TACITI

secretosque sermones jam et coram ita locutus :—‘ Omnes qui 2
magnarum rerum consilia suscipiunt, aestimare debent an
quod inchoatur reipublicae utile, ipsis gloriosum, aut promptum

effectu, aut certe non arduum sit.

Simul ipse qui suadet con-

siderandus est, adiciatne consilio periculum suurn, et, si

fortuna coeptis adfuerit, cui summum decus adquiratur.

Ego 3

te, Vespasiane, ad imperium voco, tam salutare reipublicae,
quam tibi magnificum. Juxta deos in tua manu positum est.

Nec speciem adulantis expaveris.

A contumelia quam a laude

propius fuerit post Vitellium eligi. Non adversus divi Augusti 4
acerrimam mentem, nec adversus cautissimam Tiberii senectu-
tem, ne contra Gai quidem, aut Claudii vel Neronis, fundatam

longo imperio domum exsurgimus.
Torpere ultra, et polluendam perdendamque 5

imaginibus.

Cessisti etiam Galbae

rempublicam relinquere, sopor et ignavia videretur, etiam si
tibi, quam inhonesta, tam tuta servitus esset. Abiit jam et 6

CH. LXXVI. 1 coram] Hardly

legati et amia} all present, from 78.
1, appear to be on the same terms
with him as Mucianus. M. has
coronam, but there is little doubt
the correction of the text is the
right one.

2] The preamble of the speech
is suggested by that of the Corcy-
rean ambassadors in Thuc. i. 32. 1.
The first two requisites for such a
scheme, its public and private ex-
pediency‚ are shown in § 3 to belong
to that which Mucianus proposes3
then he passes into the next—its
facility3 then, in the first half of
c. 70, he meets the further con-
siderations, ‘Does the author of
the advice give it at his own risk‚
or at yours only? will success be
for your benefit, or his only?' by
showing that he takes an equal risk
with Vespasian, and has a reason-
able motive for leaving the profit
to him.

3 Juxta deos . . . positum est]
After the gods, no one has a better
right to it ι unless the gods prevent,
it is in your power to take it.

A contumelia . . . propius]

See oni. 10. 2.

4 aut claudii vel ἔτει-01118]
Perhaps the variation of the con·
junctions is not accidental; the
sense may be to distinguish, first
the two emperors of independent
personal ability, then their heir,
too mad or too bad to do anything
to strengthen his dynasty‚ and
then the two who, having inherited
power they did not merit, still knew
how to use their strength, and
maintain their position. An attack
on Claudius or Nero might seem
less promising than one on Gaius,
though more so than on Augustus
or Tiberius.

cessisti . . .’ lmagmflms] See
on i. 49. 4. It is implied that, ex-
cept noble birth, Vespasian had at
least as good a claim to empire as
