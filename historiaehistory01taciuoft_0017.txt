apparently, of senatorial age before Vespasian's death in July
793 he was Praetor under Domitian in 88. His friend Pliny

said that the two looked over each other‘s unpublished works
ε ‘like fellow—pupils or mutual teachers,' Pliny replied that he
was the pupil and Tacitus the teacher, and makes the some-

All these notes of time concur to prove that the birth of
Tacitus cannot fall much earlier, nor any later, than the first
half of the year 54 A.D. Most commentatorS, indeed, seem

would attain the quaestorship at the earliest legal age, or
desiring to minimise the interval between his birth and
Pliny's, The first assumption falls to the ground, if we
