are regarded more hopefully, in his later works than in his
earlier 3 but his theological sentiments, like his political, are
best left in his own wordS, and not formulated more distinctly
than he himself has done.

It is of course by no means a characteristic os Tacitus
individually, but a universal one of all ancient thought, that
while he regards the truths of the divine nature and operations
as a matter on which (within certain limits) speculation is free,
religious worship is viewed as altogether a matter sor state

Ι regulation. But the fact that he accepts this principle con·

 

tentedly and without discussion, is not without influence on our
judgment of his moral and intellectual character, when we
remember that he lived in the age when, for the first time in
Europe, religion was being set on a wider than national basiS.
Among the reasons why he did not give a more thorough
adhesion to Stoicism, one no doubt waS, that he disliked it as
cosmopolitan3 the reason why he disapproved of Christianity
was substantially the same, though that is hardly the way in
which he would have expressed his disapproval.

For the assumption can hardly be justified, that Tacitus’
hostility to the new religion arose from ignorance of everything
in it beyond the name. In all likelihood, he never had such
an acquaintance with its doctrines and practices as Pliny only
gained when it came under his cognisance judicially; still, it
is scarcely possible that he can have failed to have his atten-
tion called to it by the persecution of Domitian.¹ So far
as we can gueSS, he must have approved of that measure,
though he evidently thought that of Nero barbarous. If

² That Domitian did persecute the Christians (perhaps not sparing Jews
not of jewish birth, and other Oriental sectaries) is now generally admitted.
It is the natural inference from the language of Dio (lxvii. 14), besides
being expressly stated in remarkably moderate terms by Tertullian (Apol.
c. 7).
