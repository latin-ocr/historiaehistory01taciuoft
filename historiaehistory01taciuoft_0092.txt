14 CORNELII TACITI

exercitu nihil irarum: non sane aliae legiones per omnes
civilium bellorum motus innocentius egerunt, seu quia procul
et Oceano divisae, seu crebris'expeditionibus doctae hostem
potius odisse. ’ Quies et Illyrico, quanquam excitae a Nerone 4
legiones, dum in Italia cunctantur, Verginium legationibus
adissent. Sed longfflae> spatiis discreti exercitus, quod salu· ς
berrimum est ad continendam militarem fidem, nec vitiis

CH. X. 1. famosus seems to
have about as pronounced a bad
sense as ‘ notorious ' in English.
From what follows, it is plain
Tacitus does not mean that he dis-
graced himself under all changes of
circumstances, but that he distin-
guished himself (not exactly credit-
ably) under all.
2 ambitiose] See note on i. 1. 3.
reposans] Apparently the retire-
ment was ostensibly voluntary, yet
repono is hardly one of the verbs
whose passive has naturally a reflex-
ive force. So perhaps the use of
the passive implies he had received
a hint that he had better retire3
perhaps one might translate it, ‘put

tam prope ab] ‘As little removed

suggested English equivalent is; it

Rather‚ ‘He was a man you would
praise openly,' not only because he
was too influentia] for his faults to
be mentioned as openly as his good
qualities‚ but because the faults,
