Any member of Tacitus' circle would probably have felt as
uneasy at a prodzgium non publice procuratum as it is said that
Voltaire's disciples did, if one found himself at a dinner·party
of thirteen 3 and the Roman was not in the least ashamed of

it leaves us ready to believe, though, of course, no book can
