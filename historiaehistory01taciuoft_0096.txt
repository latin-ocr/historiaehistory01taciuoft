though it would be just possible to
take it ‘reigning mistress.' But
the sense is determined by princi·

deposuerat] In the A nnals Taci-
tus tells the story differently, that
Otho seduced and then married
Poppaea, then that she became
Nero's mistress with her husband's
knowledge, and then was divorced
by him that she might marry Nero.

‘ Cur Otho mentito sit, quaeritis, exul

honore?

Uxoris moechus coeperat esse suae.’

de Vitellio] Of course if the troops
had only asserted the right of the
Senate to determine the govern-
ment, they could not have held out
against their persistence in the ex-

more dangerous when they produced
a candidate for empire of their
own. ·

comitia imperis] One may doubt
whether Tacitus means that Galba
honestly tried to carry on the mon-
archy in a republican spirit, or to
point to the unreality of affecting
to do so: transigit supports the
latter vieW. ‘He despatches the
business of electing an emperor’ by
a hole-and-corner family arrange-
ment, without consulting the peopIe,
or even the Senate.
