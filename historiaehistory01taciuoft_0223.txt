HISTORIARUM 11. 62. 145

Othonis frater, nullum discrimen adiit, pietate et ignavia 4
excusatus Mario Celso consulatus servatur. Sed creditum
fama, objectumque mox in senatu Caecilio Simplici, quod eum
honorem pecunia mercari, nec sine exitio Celsi, voluisset.
Restitit Vitellius, deditque postea consulatum Simplici innoxium 5
et inemptum. Trachalum adversus criminantes Galeria uxor
Vitellii protexit.

Inter magnorum virorum discrimina (pudendum dictu,)
Mariccus quidam, e plebe Boiorum, inserere sese fortunae et
provocare arma Romana simulatione numinum ausus est.
Jamque adsertor Galliarum et deus, (nam id sibi indiderat) 2
concitis octo milibus hominum, proximos Aeduorum pagos
trahebat, curn gravissima civitas electa juventute, adjectis a
Vitellio cohortibus, fanaticam multitudinem disjecit. Captus 3
in eo praelio MariccuS, ac mox feris objectus quia non lania·
batur, stolidum volgus inviolabilem credebat, donec spectante
Vitellio interfectus est.

had actually shown: for Tacitus

immeasurably the natural superior
clearly disbelieves the confession,

and acquits Suetonius, though not
Proculus, of even the real errors of
judgment committed.

4 uano celso] He at least was
free frc6im all suspicion of treachery,

5 Rasum] ‘Stood firm against
the temptation’: cp. 62. 1, iii.
86. 3. Some however take it,
‘ contradicted the charge against
Simplex.'

Trachalum] M. Galerius Tra-
chalus, who wrote Otho's speeches
for him, i. 90. 2, 3. Galeria was
no doubt a near relation of his.

CH. LXI. 1 magnorum virorum]
Suetonius, Celsus, and erhaps
Trachalus might fairly be led so ς
but it is doubtful whether Tacitus
means anything more distinctive
than that any Roman noble was

TAC. 11.

inserere se fortunae] ‘To thrust
himself into fortune's game,' C ‚and Β.

2 id sibl indiderat] The verb is
regularly used with nomen: it is
characteristic of Tacitus to omit that
subse, slightly varying the sense
from ‘ he had assumed that title’ to
‘he had assumed that attribute)
Probably he stood in no closer
relation to genuine Druidism than
the Hau-haus to the primitive
Maori paganism.

trahebat] Sometimes taken
‘began to ravage 3 ' rather, ‘togain
over.'

3 non laniabatur] Apparently
a not uncommon occurrence, from
the apprehensions of St. Ignatius,
ad Rom. 5.

partisans of Otho, not of Mariccus,
