INTRODUCTION. xvii

except Tacitus himself, capable of using the opportunity to

j'l so good purpose ς a few might have been found with the

patience for collecting factS, but none with equal scientific
talent for collecting the instructive ones. The really wonder-
ful thing in the Ger-many is, not the literary merit, sar less

'3² the general sentiments of the author, but the liberality and

insight which discerned the interest, historical, psychological,

Ι and even political, of the customs and institutions os the

great Barbarian nation. It is a great proof of Tacitus' genius
that he should have discerned this interest when he saw the

- things3 but it could only have been by a scarcely credible

inspiration‚ that he should have discerned it from the second·
hand evidence of men of whom the elder Pliny was the ablest.
The composition of the Ger-many, then, may be considered

’ξ as evidence of a visit to that country3 a smaller point may
ζ serve to corroborate it. In ffl‘st. iv. 2 3. 1 we have the situa-
’,τ tion of the Old Camp described in detail 3 yet its topography
had no great influence on the course of its successive siegeS,

and the works‚ weak as they were, proved sufficient to repel

⁴ the enemy till the garrison were exhausted with hunger.
’ Under these circumstanceS, it is· scarcely likely that Tacitus

 

should have written the passage referred to from the informa·
tion of another; but if he knew the ground himself, his giving
a short description of it is accounted for.

We may therefore admit it as probable that Tacitus was
Propraetor of one of the Gallo-German provinceS, since he
appears to have visited the country, and is not likely to have
done so in a private capacity. His absence from Rome,
probably from Italy, lasted at least four years; he was out
of reach when his father-in-law died in August 93.

Whatever his previous relations with Domitian, they from
this time assumed a character of settled though suppressed
hostility. He probably heard at once of Agricola's death
