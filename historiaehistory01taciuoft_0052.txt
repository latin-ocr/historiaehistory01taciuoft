themselves, may have had their saith less severely tried. If we
look to the evidence we have as t00the state of religion among
Tacitus' contemporaries, we may see signs of a reaction from un·
belief, as well as from superstition, that moved men of any religious
feeling to rally round the national gods and legitimate cere-
monies, as the best hope of truth and the best safeguard of
purity 3 Domitian himself was not only sincere but fanatical
in his reverence for them3 his personal vices are no more
evidence to the contrary than those of Philip 11. of Spain, or
James 11. of England.1 Now, though Domitian was neither a
respected nor a popular sovereign, he was by no means a
contemptible one3 those who wished to despise him were
reduced to such poor tricks as raking up and modernising old
stories of the follies of Gaius and Vitellius, It is scarcely
likely, therefore, that his influence counted for nothing, when
he threw himself with enthusiastic devotion into a cause that
few could think a bad one. Humane gentlemen like Pliny
were shocked at the execution of the Vestals 3 they professed
to doubt their guilt, and plainly thought it, even if real, much
less atrocious than their punishment. But it is hard to deny
that Domitian was in this matter the representative of the best
Roman feeling, or to see how conservative moralists like Tacitus
could disapprove of his policy. A good many people‚ who them·
selveS, if they ever worshipped anybody, worshipped Isis, and
if they ever practised any moral virtue, did not practise
chastity, nevertheless expected some harm to come to Rome
and to themselves from the Dacians, or Germans, or some-
body, if the Vestals were not virginS, or if the worship of the
gods of Rome were not kept up in the ancient Roman manner.
Now this claSS, if not very respectable, was so large as to be

Roman religion as theirs of the Christian, though the moral precepts of the
former were not as clearly enunciated as the Decalogue.
