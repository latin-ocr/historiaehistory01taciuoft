xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

Dialogue it is perhaps no more than the necessary result of
the subject, that we get few references to the ages before that
of the incipient revolution 3 yet it is significant that the author
insists on and exaggerates the neamess in time of the Republi-
can period 3 still more so is the passage where he suggests
Menenius Agrippa as the type of a really ancient Roman
orator. In the great historical works, notices like that of the
unconstitutional deposition of Caecina, of the unprecedented
adoption of Nero, or even of the rather silly remark made upon
Augustus' thirteen consulships, are symptoms of this character·
istic feeling or method3 while in passages like the exordium .
of the AnnaIs, or Iiz‘st. ii. 38, iii. 72, Ann. xi. 22, we have it
deliberately expressed and applied. The antiquarianism of
ffi’st. iv. 83 sqq„ Ann. xi. 14, and other passages that might
be named, is a natural outgrowth of this view of history. An
unsympathetic reader might think that the taste for anti-
quarianism was the cause, the sense of the value of historical
antiquities the effect3 but that this would be unjust both to
Tacitus and to his age is proved by their judgment on a mere
antiquarian like Claudius.

It would be more satisfactory to many of Tacitus' readers
now, if it were possible to deduce from his works a consistent
scheme of what he thought ought to be the respective powers
of the Prince and the Senate 3 if, in fact, he had sketched a
paper constitution for the Rome or the Roman Empire of his
day. So it would have been more satisfactory to readers of
an earlier generation‚ if Tacitus' offer to his readers had been
the same as Livy's, Inde tibi tuaeque respublicae quod imitere
capim, inde foedum inceptu, foedum exitu, quod vites. The
devout and yet not disinterested spirit in which he is quoted
by such a writer as Sir A. Alison (who quotes him very often,
and by no means stupidly) is nearly the same to which we are
accustomed in quotations from another Volume—
