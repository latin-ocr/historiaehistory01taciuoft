Tacitus appears to have conceived as a theory that system of
ἴ succession that in fact answered best 3 the wisdom proved by
his conception of it is the greater, that its practical value was
shown at least as much after his time as before. He held that
the Emperor should designate his successor under the form of
adoption3 this would avoid the dangers of an interregnum,
J which, with two co-ordinate and independent powers in the
’ᾗ state, would be virtual anarchy3 and at the same time, the

the adoption of Piso by Galba, and of Trajan by Nerva. The
earlier precedents were not so encouraging as to make mani·

Antonines 3 but the genius of Tacitus discerned the promise,
ῗ which h'e puts into the mouth of the unfortunate Galba, as
though by way of consolation sor his failure to fulfil it.
Α Tacitus’ opinions on speculative subjects are perhaps more
definitely to be ascertained than on political‚ though it is pro-

. less closely connected with the substance of his work, we feel
⁴ more interest, and are more easily aroused to sympathy, for
' , his partial and not very successful guesses at ‘ the riddle of the
painful earth,' than for his diagnosiS, or even his hints on the

  

regimen, of the hypertrophy of the Roman body politic. The

’ questions he asked of himself, or of heaven and earth, are

among the questions which men are still asking, with or with·

out an answer or the hope of one 3 moreover‚ we may to some

extent learn what questions to ask, and how, if at all, to
