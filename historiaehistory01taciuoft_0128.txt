permisit.

7 fiscum suum] He only com-
mitted himself, not his successors.

rem . . . utilem] In apposition
to the sentence which forms the
object to promisit .· see the last note
on c. 44.

postea] Vitellius had already
adopted the plan independently,
inf. 58. 1. The rather cumbrous
device of the commander paying
sees for the soldiers was practically
what we should call the recognition
of a vested interest. In the eyes of
Juvenal (xiv. 194 sqq.) the attrac-
tion‚ such as it was, of a centurion's
post, was not glory but money.

8 tamquam . . . seponeretur. . .
confossus] ‘Was stabbed under
pretence of being sent into banish-
ment.' The Latin order of the
sentence, keeping the main predicate
till the end, helps to excuse a slight
confusion in the connexion of words.

Laco was not ‘stabbed as though,

he were going into exile,’ but first

Pisonem Verania uxor ac frater Scribonianus, Titum 4

treated as though going into exile,
and then stabbed.

libertum] More contemptuous
than libertinum. That would mean
that he belonged to an ignoble class ;
this treats him as a mere member
of Galba's household, whose death
was a matter of course, and of no
interest, after his master's.

CH. XLVII. 1 Vocat . . . ur·
banus] The constitutional course

when both consuls were killed or ’ ’

absent3 Cic. ad Fam. x. 12. 3 3 so
also Liv. xxii. 55. 1.

2 quae . . . nemo sensit] Does
Tacitus mean to blame them for not

reflecting that Othowould remember ’

them, or to praise him for not
making them feel that he did ¹? Per·
haps both, but the next sentence
shows that the latter was more
present to his mind.

3 in capitolium] To offer sacri-
sices, which, it is said, were as
unfavourable as Galba's.
