INTRODUCTION. lxv

’ Of his grammatical variations from prose usage and approxi-
mation to that of poetry, the widest in range is a tendency to
do more by case inflexions and less by prepositionS. He
omits ag. oftener than most writers the preposition with the
2ablative of motion from a place ; he uses also the simple
ablative of rest in a place, when the noun designating the
place either has an epithet or a genitive depending on and
qualifying it. Similarly, he extends the usage of the simple
accusative to express motion to a place 3 he uses it with the
names not only of toWnS, but os nations or countries (in Anu.

” xii. 32. 1, we should probably read inde Cangos). He uses the

 

dative of the agent freely.

With this tendency to omit prepositions may be compared
another, common to him and Lucan, to use simple verbs in
‘the sense of compoundS.

The substantival use of adjectives is common.

In the order of wordS, he has a tendency to put the subject
at the end of the sentence. This is commoner in poetry than
prose.

He'has not very many uses of words exclusively poetical;
sistere, ‘to place, set in a certain spot ’ (as Virg. Aen. iv‚ 634),
‚and cognomentum, in the mere sense of ‘ name,' may be so eon—
sidered3 also sponte with the genitive is characteristic of
Tacitus and Lucan. He is fond of verbals in -tor, and has
-several which are either peculiar to him, or are elsewhere
poetieal or post-classical.

ΙΙΙ. Varieties in construction are of course difficult to
vclassify3 in many cases, they consist simply in this, that
whereas any writer might have constructed a sentence on
either of two plans, Tacitus has chosen to construet half on
one and half on the other. Under this head, however, may

be grouped most of those peculiarities of construction which
do not fall under either of the former.
