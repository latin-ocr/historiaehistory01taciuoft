for African service.

2 adpulsu uteris] So M. for the
vulgate appulsus litori ; the simple

Vitellius a little later, iii. 38 sq.

‘so good, that he could afford to be
rich (without being less generous);
better simply ‘rich in proportion’
to his generosity.
4 circumposuit] ‘ Placed on
the two sides of‚’ an unusual use of
czrcum.
