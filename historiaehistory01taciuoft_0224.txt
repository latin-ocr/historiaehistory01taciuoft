146 CORNELII TACITI

fuere eorum qui acie Othoniana ceciderant testamenta, aut lex
intestatis. Prorsus, si luxuriae temperaret, avaritiam non
timeres. Epularum foeda et inexplebilis libido: ex urbe 2
atque Italia inritamenta gulae gestabantur, strepentibus ab
utroque mari itineribus; exhausti conviviorum apparatibus
principes civitatum 3 vastabantur ipsae civitates ; degenerabat
a labore ac virtute miles adsuetudine voluptatum, et contemptu
ducis. Praemisit in urbem edictum quo vocabulum Augusti 3
differret, Caesaris non reciperet, curn de potestate nihil detra-
heret. Pulsi Italia mathematici. Cautum severe ne equites
Romani ludo et arena polluerentur. Priores id principes 4
pecunia et saepius vi perpulerant 3 ac pleraque municipia et
coloniae aemulabantur corruptissimum quemque adolescentium
pretio inlicere.

expected the whole senate to be,

though it may be meant that the
or affect to be, shocked at hearing

ridiculous civil war served to dis-

tract attention from the tragical one.
But it is disputed how the Otho-
nians can be called defectores, for
Vitellius as well as they had revolted
from Galba. Perhaps it means
those who deserted during the war,
(the crebra transfugia of 34. 1 seem
to have been mutual) 3 if not, it is
enough to say that a successful
usurper always claims to have been
a legitimate monarch srom the first 5
and that Vitellius actually (i. 74 6)
traded upon the fact that he had
been proclaimed before Otho.

temperaret] The impf. from
the point of view osa contemporary,
which the sense of non timeres
makes the natural one.

2 adsuetudine voluptatum]
Apparently Vitellius had, from his
arrival on the Rhine, introduced
among them the habit of breakfast-
ing on bread and wine (jentaculum).
Probably there it was a good thing
for thern, but in Italy it may have
been unwholesome‚ and certainly
was thought intemperate. Cicero

that Antony used to have a dejeuner
at >eight or nine (Phil. ii. 41.
104 .

contemptu ducis seems to have
been rather what Tacitus thought
ought to have resulted than what
did. Vitellius kept his popularity
with the common soldiers to the
last.

3 differret] Probably till he
reached Rome. In both matters
he wished to act civiliter .· he meant
to take supreme power, but supreme
dignity should only be granted to
him deliberately, and a dynastic
title he would not bear at all.
Compare i. 62. 4

mathematici] They had made
themselves conspicuous on Otho's ·
side, i. 22 sq. Suetonius says
they were ordered to withdraw by
October 1st : they said, ‘Very well,
Vitellius would not be alive then.'
But he lived nearly two months
longer.

severe] In agood sense, as usual.
But Vitellius, Tacitus means to
