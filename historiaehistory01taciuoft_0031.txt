INTRODUCTION. xxv

·‘ for two months only. To have done so would not only have

- been a disappointment to the members of consular families
who expected the routine of office to carry thern, is duly
qualified‚ to the same point as their fathers 3 it would also
η ,have seriously interfered with public business to diminish the
, 'number of consulars available for provincial or other offices
which law or custom sorbade to be assigned to men of lower
rank. From the beginning of March Λα). 97, therefore,
Tacitus must have retired from office and pursued the pre-
paration of his works for publication or recitation.

Early in the following year Nerva died 3 almost irn-
mediately¹ the Life of Agricola was issued, and it was inti·

, mated in the Preface that this was only an instalment of a

Ι larger work, a History of the whole period of the Flavian
Dynasty. In the same year, the Ger-many was completed 3
it is an amusing bit of republican formalism that he dates
the work from Trajan’s second Consulship, not from the first
- year of his Principate. Whether this date is that of the
publication, as it may be presumed that it was of the cotn-
j pletion, of the tract, is a little less certain3 the most reason-
able view as to the author's purpose in its composition is,
that it was published with the ffi'ston‘es as an Excursus or
Appendix. But the ,Histories themselves may well have been

Ῑ ’ ready at the end of this year or in the couxse of the next 3 it
’ is implied by what is said of them in the Agricola that they
» were not to be long delayed. xWe must remember that
publication was at Rome less of a single, and, so to speak,

 

’ momentary act than in modern or even mediaeval times 3 the
author may not have cared to alter what had been read to a
- circle of friends that included most of their expected readem,

. even though a few years might pass before he sent the MS.

· Divus, at the beginning3 Trajan is called princeps at the end.
