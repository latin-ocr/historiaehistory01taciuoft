5,6] It appears there really
was a Dea Aventica of the town
Aventicum (the modern Avenches)
-from which facts, combined with
those of the text, Wilhelm con-
structed his forgery of the retty
inscription celebrated by yron

, (caude Harold, iii. 66, n 16). He
, imagined a daughter of this Alpinus
interce-:ling to ugCaecina for his life·
Byron, in ignorance of the real
story, imagined a fictitious one, as
with Bonnivard, while Simpkinson
supplied a poeti'cal treatment of the
real one. But the spuriousness of

the inscription is beyond question.
C1-1. LXIX. 1] Here commences

a lacuna· ιιι Μ., reaching to 75. 4;
for the intervening chapters we are
dependent on copies of M. made
before its mutilation, which ιιι other
of ιι are of no practical value.

2 manuus] One MS. has Cor-
nelius, but the collocation of the
names Cornelius Cossus might occur

to a transcribet from his reading
while we have no instance (at least
as early as this) of a patrician cog-
nomen being assumed by one of the

new citizens affiliated to a patrician
house. It is credible enough that
one of the innumerable Claudii os
Gaul (59.1) should have taken a
name fross early Roman history;
on the other hand, it was not rare
for noble families to sink out of
view under Augustus or Tiberius,
their representatives retiring or
being expelled from the Senate; so
he may have been a real patrician
Cossus after all, a son or grandson
of one so attainted.

eo vaudtor] One might illustrate
from the story told of Lord Ashley’s
speech on trials for troeson (Mac-
aulay, c. 21).

immodicus . . . tuerat] The
MSS. have immodicum, which some
would retain, omitting ficerat. But
the insertion of the plup. is more
like Tacitus than a copyist; the
tense is determined rather by its
fitness to the special case of this
army than to the general principle
ut est mos vulgo.

impunitatem salutemque] Rather
an anticlimax, ‘ that the city should

neither be punished nor destroyed.‘
