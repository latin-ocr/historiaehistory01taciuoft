lxii INTRODUCTION.

ality, and also the least valuable characteristic of the three.
And these impressions‚ spontaneously arising, may be justified
deductively. Tacitus is brief, because it is his nature or his
choice to concentrate his whole attention on the point before
him for the moment3 he is poetical, because he lives in an
artificial‚ literary age, and the habit of thinking in terms of
what he has -read has become natural to him; but when we
ask why he varies his constructions arbitrarily‚ the principle
le style c’est l'lcomme seems to fail us 3 we can only answer that
he does it ‘because it was the way to be striking,' or ‘ because
he thought it would look clever.'

The three peculiarities1 may be successively analysed in
detail, though no analysis can be so accurate as to dispense
with the necessity of personal verification, or so complete as
to supersede the instinctive insight that only comes from per-
sonal familiarity with the author. It thus appears useless to
quote illustrative passages, unless really necessary to illustrate
the terms used in describing them3 each rule of Tacitean
language, if rightly reckoned as characteristic, will have a
good many illustrations to be quoted for it, and the student
who collects his own will be likely to appreciate the rule
best, and (what is more important), to appreciate Tacitus
best.

Ι. Of course the simplest method of securing brevity in a
sentence is to leave out some of the words of which it is
naturally composed. Ellipsis is very frequent in Tacitus, not
for the sake of mere brevity, but in general because the words
omitted are pointless oneS‚ only connecting links between the

de ellipsz‘ T adtinet, and Goebel, de Taciti poetico stili colore. They are pro·
bably not generally accessible in England ; A. A. Draeger’s exhaustive
work Ueber S yntax und Stil des Tacitus, isit is not, ought to be. There
is little in the text that is not found in one or the other of these, or at
least suggested by them.
