nulla . . . impunitatis] Tbey
do not take the precaution of abs-
taining from crimes, but leave the
crimes of others unpunished, that
these in turn may leave their own.

5 odium . . . invidia] The
former is the more definite and
active feeling3 it also perhaps im-
pii-es pioretptgsitixffly· ill deeds of its
o ec asls oun aion.

huonis] It would be tempting
to read salmom. -

mammas aquas] He had,
no doubt, gone there for the baths,
which, as at Baiae, would attract a
mssoenaneous and dissolute society.
But, according to Plutarch, he
attempted to escape by sea, which
it seems strange to us that scarcely
any victims of the suprema neces-
sitm (sup. 3. 1.) thought of doing.

wormes moras] According to
Plutarch, he offered bribes to the
mmger ; the bribe being re-
iected, then offered it as a present 3
then (like Landor’s dying French-
man) asked to be allowed to shave,
and used the opportunity to eut
his throat with the razor.

foedavit . . . inhonesto] Taci-
tus probably accepts the same
account as Plutarch, though he
gives fewer details; but he thinks
it improper to have made any
effort at all sor life, and perhaps
applies to his mode os death a con·
ventional standard os propriety:
to cut your own throat was dis·

illustrations of the sentiments de-
termining the etiquette in these
matters of honour. Plutarch gives,
and probably meant to give, the
impression that Tigellinus ‘did it
after the high Roman sashion,’ as
well as the more gentlemanly pro·
fligates Asiaticus, Petronius, and
Otho.

Probably ‘ disguising his purpose
