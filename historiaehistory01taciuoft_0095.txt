‘HISTORIARUM Ι. 1 3. 17

Quippe hiantes in magna fortuna amicorum cupiditates ipsa ς
Galbae facilitas intendebat, cum apud infirmum et credulum Ψ
13 minore metu et majore praemio peccaretur. Potentia princi· “
patus divisa in Titum Vinium consulem et Cornelium Laconem
praetorii praefectum. Nec minor gratia Icelo Galbae liberto, 2
“ quem anulis donatum equestri nomine Marcianum vocitabant.
Hi discordeS, et rebus minoribus sibi quisque tendenteS, circa 3
consilium eligendi successoris in duas factiones scindebantur.
Vinius'pro M. Othone: Laco atque Icelus consensu non tam 4
unum aliquem fovebant quam alium. Neque erat Galbae 5
ignota Othonis ac Titi Vinii amicitia ; et rumoribus nihil
silentio transmittentium, (quia Vinio vidua filia, caelebs Oth0‚)

is rig 'tly rejected by Orelli.

5 intendebat] As we say, ‘ inten-
sified ς’ perhaps gave an aim as
well as an impetus, like arcum in-

harsh is perhaps not impossible.

the omission would be probable.

2 aqueum nomine] His official
name would naturally have been
Ser. Sulpicius Icelus 3 but he would
have continued to be called by the
Greek name at the end, which would
have reminded every one of his
origin, and this was undesirable in
the case of an eques=Romanus. So
no doubt he was called Ser. Sulpi-

There is no knowing what deter-

mined the choice os the name—per·

haps Galba had inherited him from
a Marcius.

3 sibl quisque . . . duas] About
other things there were three parties,
about this tw0; while the momen·

did not g‘o beyond opposing Vinius.

5 Neque . . . et] Galba was on
these accounts afraid that the choice
of Otho would make Vinius too
powersul.

vidua nna] The Crispina of i.
47. 4, mentioned also i. 72. 4.

caelebs] &Vithout a wife at
present: viduus is rarely used sub·
stantivally, or in the distinctive
sense of a widower. And besides,
Tacitus regards his marriage with
Po paea as merely nominal.

for as much as Galba’s reputation
would promise.
