entered the Senate ; and again we hear of another Cornelius
(Hm ii. 86. 5), who, whether patrician or not, senatorium
ordinem exuerat. If an ancestor of Tacitus’ had done the
same, two or three generations back, it is intelligible that a

³ man who had abdicated nobility without forfeiting respecta-
; , bility, should be mentioned with the respect he retained, but

without ,allusion to the pretensions he had renounced, which,

j in his present modest condition, it might be ridiculous to
remember. On the other hand, Julius Graecinus (Agr. 4. r)
⁸ was no patrician JuliuS‚ but merely a citizen of the vetus et
s illustris· Forqy'ultknsium colonia ,· yet he inherited and married
ζ into an equestris· nobilitas, and, without exciting astonishment,

attained and bequeathed a senatorial. Now Tacitus' citizen·
ship was in any case a generation older than his father-in-
law's 3 it may therefore have been regarded as old, and have
enabled him, without vanity or affectation, to assume the
tone of a genuine Roman, and one of no mean birth.

The truth is, that the question of the origin of Tacitus'
family is less important than it looks, being quite distinct

’ from the more interesting question of its social position at
-sst-*f his birth. By his time the historical nobility of Rome was
“ disappearing, though the aristocratical tradition, which the
t early Emperors had more or less respected, was not re-
  cognised to be growing obsolete. The Nobility in the

technical sense—the hierarchy of office—had become even
more systematised under the Empire than in the most oli—

’- garchical days of the Republic-; but the old Senatorial oligarchy,
η which had been shaken and discredited by the Gracchi and

MariuS, and had been to some extent liberalised and reformed
at its restoration by Sulla, was utterly disorganised in the
Caesarian Civil WarS. Julius had introduced the principle
of la carribre ouverte aux talents, the denial of which had
alienated his uncle; Augustus saw that, this principle being
