CORNELII TACITI

Posito ubique bello, magna pars senatus extremum discrimen
adiit, profecta cum Othone ab urbe, dein Mutinae relicta.
Illuc adverso de praelio adlatum. Sed milites, ut falsum, 2
rumorem aspernantes, quod infensum Othoni senatum arbitra-
bantur, custodire sermones, voltum habitumque trahere in
deterius3 conviciis postremo ac probris causam et initium
caedis quaerebant, cum alius insuper metus senatoribus
instaret, ne, praevalidis jam Vitellii partibus, cunctanter exce-

pisse victoriam crederentur.

Ita trepidi, et utrinque anxii, 3

coeunt, nemo privatim expedito consilio, inter multos societate

culpae tutior.

Onerabat paventium curas ordo Mutinensis

arma et pecuniam offerendO, appellabatque patres conscriptos

intempestivo honore.

Notabile jurgium fuit, quo Licinius

Caecina Marcellum Eprium ut ambigua disserentem invasit.
N ec ceteri sententias aperiebant : sed invisum memoria delatio-
num, expositumque ad invidiam, Marcelli nomen inritaverat

2 quod3. . . arbitrabantur] Com-
pare i. 82. 2. We may perhaps
see in the respective policies of
Vitellius and Otho, the first symp-
toms of what became afterwards the
main problem of Roman history-—
whether the emperor should be ap-
pointed by and rest on the Senate
or the army—especially the Prae-
torians. But, by a curious irony,
Vitellius was thrown into a false
position, and had to rest (i. 74. 6)
on the fact of his earlier proclama-
tion by a mutinous army, while
Otho (i. 84. 6-10) claimed to be
the lawfully recognised head of the
state, and champion of the city and
constitution.

3 tutior agrees with quisque, to
be supplied from nemo. So Hor.
Sat. i. 1. 1-3.

ordo] A commoner term than
senatus for the corporation of a
municipal town3 the individual

members were decuriones.
mtempestivo honore] Because it
threw on them the responsibility of
deciding who was the real princeps.
It was also a constitutional solecism z
there was enough of a senate to
meet at Rome (55. 3), and no
meeting of senators elsewhere could
assume the tit1e; even the Pom-

is careful to make the apvgointment
of Camillus as dictator, in the
Gallie siege, quite regular in this

worth while to attack him, however
unreasonable the present plea.
