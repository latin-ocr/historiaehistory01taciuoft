xii INTRODUCTION.

believe Tacitus not to have been of senatorial family3 he
may, as Ritter says, have enjoyed the inffnsus honorum
cursus, but he had first to win‚ by his own merits‚ the first
step upon it. The second argument, though deserving more
consideration, is hardly decisive 3 it is rather curious that a man
of perhaps thirty-seven should say to a man of forty-seven that
they were nearly of an age, but it does not materially lessen
the difficulty if we reduce the difference of their years from ten
to eight. Pliny, we know, was born i'n A.D. 61-2, and began
to practise in the Forum at nineteen ; now by that time we
know, from Tacitus' own wordS, that his position was estab-
lished and his steady rise begun 3 he may have been only
twenty—six, but is as likely to have been a year or two older.

We may thus venture to begin the story of Tacitus' life as
known to us with his birth in A.D. 52 or soon after. He
must have assumed the toga virilis either during or im-
mediately after the ‘long year' of the Civil 'Wars, and, though
not an immediate spectator of their events, must in all likeli-

current of popular feeling during their course, at least in his
own neighbourhood and among his own class.

It would be interesting if we could be sure that his child-
hood had been passed, in part, in Northern Gaul; it would
not only help to account for the existence of his invaluable
tract on Germany, but would also connect itself with the
length and vigour of his description of the revolt of Civilis,
of which he seems, more fully than either contemporary or
later historianS, to have discerned the fatal significance.
Civilis was scarcely an Alaric, or at any rate the Batavians
of the first century were a very different nation from the Goths
of the fifth 3 and the rash, vain, soft-hearted Sabinus was
as ridiculous a precursor as could well be imagined for Theo-
doric or Charlemagne3 yet the Germano-Gallic revolt con-
