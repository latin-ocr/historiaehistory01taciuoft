2 CORNELII TACITI

populi Romani memorabantur, pari eloquentia ac libertate.
Postquam bellatum apud Actium atque omnem potentiam ad 2
unum conferri pacis interfuit, magna illa ingenia cessere,
simul veritas pluribus modis infracta, primum* inscitia rei
publicae ut alienae, mox libidine adsentandi aut rursus odio

eighteen ; reading octingentos et tri-
ginta, this would give the common
date.

res populi Romani] ‘The his·
tory of the nation of Rome,'
opposed to that of the court. We
have a similar expression as well
as thought 1n Ann. i. 1. 4‚iV. 32. 1.

eloquentia ac libertate] The
loss of the first quality is indicated
by magna . . . cessere, that of the
second by veritas . . . infracta.

2 Postquam . . . cessere]
Tacitus means that the monarchy
established after Actium cut off the
supply of great historiam, as well
as that it was the limit of the time
treated by great historians. Livy,
though he wrote under Augustus,
had grown up under the Republic ;
and if not exactly a republican, was
called by Augustus a Pompeian.

potentiana] So M. Bekker‚
following the secondary MSS- and
Ernesti, wished to read potestatem,
because ‘potestas conftrtur, potentia
paratur.’ The truth is, potentia
means extra-legal, potestas, legal
power; now the empire might be
conceived as either, according to
men's political views‚ and the
oxymoron potentiam conferri very
accurately expresses Tacitus’s own
attitude towards the question be-
tween them. In the abstract, all
despotic power was an usurpation ;
in fact, it was undeniable that the
despotism was the only lawful or
possible govemment. In Ann.
iii. 69. 6, we have both nouns (and
imperium also) used of the imperial
power—potentia there being, as
usual, meant as a rather invidious
word.

veritas] Means, perhaps, more
osten ‘truthfulness ' (as here) than
‘truth,' while verus is oftener
‘ real' of things or ‘true ' of pro-

insuffla rei publicae ut alienae]
‘ Ignorance of the nation' s affairs,
as not being affairs of theirs,’ but
of the nation' s single ruler. Res-

publica is exactly the same as the

res populi Romani of the last ξ.
So it ought to be etymologically
(Cic. de Rep. i. 26. 41), and so Per-
sius (iv. 1), Rem populi tractas,’ metri
gratia, where in prose one would
say, rempublicam tractare or capes-
sere. Respublica, though it sometzmes
passes from the abstract‘ state affairs’
to the concrete ‘‚'state never leaves
its etymology quite behind it;
hence, while in literal meaning
exactly equivalent to the English

c‘(>mmonwealth,' in political ter-
minology it is more like‘ constitu-
tion' (in Sall. Cat. 51. 17, ‘aliena
a republica nostra' is exactly our

‘unconstitutional '.) Like ‘-con
stitution’ or πολιτεία, respublica
tends to imply popular freedom, and
does imply recognition of popular
rights; but it does not imply a
‘ republican ’ form of govemment ;
perhaps it comes nearest to it in
i. 16. Ι, 5ο. 3, while we see the
tendency in this passage and the
parallel exordium to the Annals.
It excludes a despotism or δυναστεία
where the ruler or rulers rem suam
agunt, non publicam, but not a
legitimate and national monarchy,
even though as absolute as the .
Persian (Cic. l.c. sqq.)
