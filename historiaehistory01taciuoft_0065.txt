mannerism of style, absent from his earliest work, grows more
and more marked in each of his later, yet there is an increase
of literary power more than proportionate to the diminution
os literary spotlessneSS. In truth, we scarcely feel a marked
individual mannerism to be a blemish‚ when it is the protest

” ff of a strong mind against the conventional sashions fixed by

inferior ones 3 we feel that Tacitus first learnS, and proves that
he has learnt, to write as correct Ciceronian Latin as if he
were fit for nothing but a rhetorician of the Ciceronian school,

τ’ ‘and that he thereby makes good his own claim to go his own

way, despising the rules of art which hamper him, not neglect·
ing them while needing their guidance.

The detailed consideration of the literary character os the
Dialogue scarcely belongs to our present subject, but to the

'¹ ¹ interesting though not very popular¹ study of the art of rhetoric

 

Hister-ies were arranged as a continuous whole, and contained thirty books
between them. It is therefore generally assumed that the AnnaLr con·
tained sixteen, the Htktoriss fourteen. But Ritter very plausibly argues,
that the last year and a half of N ero's reign, and the six months aster his
¹ death, were too eventsul to be comprised in half a book ; so he concludes
that the Annals contained eighteen, and the Htkton'es only twelve; the
latter being, he calculates‚ enough for the period contained in them, on
the same scale of treatment as in the Annals. But twelve or even sour-
teen books are not enough for the period, on the same scale of treatment as
the extant part of the Histories, allow as much as we will for the excep·
tionally eventful character of the first ‘long year.’ I venture to conjecture,
that St. Jerome referred to the Histories only, which contained thirty
books, but that by carelessness or lapse of memory he introduced an
irrelevant reference to the whole period treated by Tacitus. It may be
held to support this theory, that his younger contemporary Orosius, while
making frequent use of the szvtomks, especially of the now lost portions,
seems to know nothing of the Annals ; St. Jerome, on this vieW, knew
of their existence, but had not a copy by him. It is certain that he is
inaccurate in the title of the work he cites, whether it were more or less
extensive.
