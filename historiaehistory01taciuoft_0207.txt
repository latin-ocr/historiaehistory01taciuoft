alii ς, incertus undique clamor adcurrentium‚ vocitantium. Ut 7
cuique audacia vel formid0, in primam postremamve aciem
'42 prorumpebant aut relabebantur. Attonitas subito terrore
mentes falsum gaudium in languorem vertit, repertis qui de-
scivisse a Vitellio exercitum ementirentur. Is rumor, ab explo- 2
ratoribus Vitellii dispersuS, an in ipsa Othonis parte seu dolo
seu forte surrexerit, parum compertum. Omisso pugnae ardore
Othoniani ultro salutavere3 et hostili murmure excepti, pleris-
que suorum ignaris quae causa salutandi, metum proditionis
fecere. Tum incubuit hostium acieS‚ integris ordinibus, 3
robore et numero praestantior: Othoniani, quanquam dispersi,
paucioreS, fessi, praelium tamen acriter sumpsere. Et per 4
locos arboribus ac vineis inpeditos non una pugnae facies:
comminus eminuS, catervis et cuneis concurrebant. In aggere
viae conlato gradu corporibus et umbonibus niti, omisso
pilorum jactu, gladiis et securibus galeas loricasque perrum-
pere: noscentes inter se, ceteris conspicui, in eventum totius

-ωἰίιιιιοοιήῑιιΠΨ dise giigilgisie clamor] In
stead of the cheers of men going

7vel...ve...aut] Varied
for variety’s sake3 the three pairs
manifestly correspond to each other.

CH.XLII. 1 inlanguorem] Their
first feeling was ‘ We are surprised,’
their second, ‘ It’s all right, they
will not fight us‚' their third, ‘There
is no knowing what is eoming= we
can't help it.'

2 omaso] ‘ Letting the oppor-
tunity pass for’ . . . ‚ just like omisso
pilorum jactu in ἓ 4.

3 dispersi] Opposed to integris
ordinibus, pauciores to numero, and
fessi to robore.

describes the character of the en·
counter all along the line, from
north to south.

catervis et cunels] The Gennans
in the former, the legionaries in the
latter. The two formations do not
differ very widely—each is a column
charging with the broadsword ; but
the cuneus is apparently the deeper,
and certainly the closer, and charac-
teristic of disciplined troops as the
other is of barbarians.

111 eventum totius bem] ‘ They
were fighting to decide the whole
issue of the war ' (C. and B.)—
rather describing their feelings than
the actual result. The Vitellians
