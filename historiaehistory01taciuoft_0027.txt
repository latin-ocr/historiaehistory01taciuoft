Ner0, and 'the other forces casually present in the city, in
proclaiming a pretender of their own 3 they easily destroyed
the Senate's emperor, and the Senate was not slow in acknow-
ledging theirS. But meanwhile, on every one os the military
frontiers of the Empire, with two exceptionS, a more or less
formidable pretender had appeared. In Africa, in Germany,
in Judaea and the East, either soldiers or generals thought

f¹ that they had as good a right as the one legion of Spain or

κ Gaul to appoint an emperor, though sometimes the two dis-
’2 agreed as to the fitness of the general on the spot to be

appointed. In Illyricum and in Britain there was happily no
general of energy or popularity sufficient to qualify him sor
a pretender3 the latter army acquiesced in the choice of their
nearest neighbourS‚ the former at first in that of the capital,
afterwards in that of the East. For a whole year there was
virtual anarchy; the Senate could only get their name re-
spected by lending it to the nearest or the last victorious of
the military claimantS. It was treated with decent respect by
Otho, with something more by Vitellius and Vespasian, but
no Senator could help feeling that their power rested on the

army, and that the influence of his own body, though a real
one, existed only on sufferance.

Domitian had insulted the Senate by his domestic con-
claves at Alba, before he began to oppress or to thin the order.
Coming after active and successful generals like his father
and brother, it is remarkable that he, though not personally
active nor uniformly successful, seems to have retained a
genuine popularity with the army3 the explanation probably
is, that what was wanting to him in military fame, he made
up, partly by a sincere desire for it, and partly by a politic

l devotion to military interestS. The course of the revolt of

Saturninus, and the measures adopted on its repression, seem
to show that the army of Germany was only engaged in it
