CORNELII TACITI

aeque provinciam exercitumque accendit quam quod adsevera-
bat Mucianus statuisse Vitellium, ut Germanicas legiones in
Suriam ad militiam opulentam quietamque transferret, contra
Suriacis legionibus Germanica hiberna, caelo ac laboribus dura,
mutarentur. Quippe et provinciales sueto militum contubernio 5
gaudebant, plerique necessitudinibus et propinquitatibus mixti 3
et militibus vetustate stipendiorum nota et familiaria castra in
modum penatium diligebantur. Ante Idus Julias Suria omnis
in eodem sacramento fuit. Accessere cum regno Sohaemus
haud spernendis viribUS, Antiochus vetustis opibus iugem, et
inservientium regum' ditissimus. Mox per occultos suorum 2
nuntios excitus ab urbe Agrippa, ignaro adhuc Vitellio, celeri
navigatione properaverat. N ec minore animo regina Berenice
partes juvabat, florens aetate formaque, et seni quoque Vespa-
siano magnificentia munerum grata. Quicquid provinciarum 3
adluitur mari Asia atque Achaia tenus, quantumque introrsus
in Pontum et Armenios patescit, juravere. Sed inermes legati
regebant, nondum additis Cappadociae legionibus, Consilium 4

but a Roman lowered his dignity by
laying himself out for the applause

of Greeks.
5 plerique . . . mixti] If a

fourth of each maniple (i. 46. 4) was
usually off duty and mixed with the
civil population‚ barrack-life would
be less unbroken, and the inter-
course between the soldiers and the
civil population freer than in modern
regular armies, and the obstacles to
soldiers marrying proportionately
less. -

vetustate supenmorum] Except
for the exigencies of a campaign
now and then, and such more per-
manent changes as the conquest of
Britain, the legions had been rarely
transferred since the settlement of
the empire.

CH. LXXXI. 1 cum regno 80-
haemus] Ann. xiii. 7. 2.

Antiochus . . . ditissimus] See
on 2 5. 3.

2 ab urbe Agrippa] He had
started thither with Titus to con-
gmtdlate Galba, but unlike him
(sup. ιι, ’2) went on in hopes to gain
eredit with the new emperor. 1f
he had gained the character of an
Othonian‚ a union between him and
veleaSian was for the interests of
bot .

florens aetate] She must have
been at least forty, twelve years
older than her lover. Both in
Italy and the East women of this
period seem to have retained their
charms late, in spite of what
we should think unnaturally early
marriages.

sem quoque vespasiano] Her
attractions to the younger being
notorious, and having been men-
tioned by Tacitus in c. 2. 1, 2.

3 nondum . . . legionibus]
They were first sent there by Ves-
pasian when emperor.
