another good excuse for visiting
Rome. At the same time, ferebat
may be meant to contrast his alleged
motive‚ not with a real one, but
with the imagined one.

maturam . . . juventam] He
was now just twenty-eight.

3 disperserat] Apparently the
only place where this word is thus
used without rumorem or some
similar word to define its meaning.
In fact it appears to be oftener used
in this sense by Tacitus than by any
other writer, see, ag. 96. 3.

intemperantia . . . destinandl]
The genitive is the same in principle
as in phrases like intemperantia vini,
so inpotens is often used (eg. iv.
44. 3) with perhaps a conscious
imitation of the construction of
ἀκρατής. But this use of the gerund
seems to be unique, though it is
needless to conjecture destinantis.

4 decor oris] Compare i. 7. 5
for the weight of this consideration
with the masses.

prosperae Vespasiani res] Not
merely that the son of a distin·

guished. man was brought before
the public's eye and the emperor's,
but that the son of a lucky man
was likely to be lucky.

5 cuneta. utrinque may be ‘ all
considerations on both sides‚' ι’. e. in
favour of going on or turning back,
or ‘ all events from both quarters,'
i.e. his possible treatment either by
Vitellius or Otho.

6—8s1...81n...sm] The
form of the sentence supports the
first translation suggested for utrim-
que. At the same time, the last sin
prevents its being so symmetrical as
to be decisive. Its force is z—There
were objections to either course—
stronger to one than to the other-—
but a third alternative was con-
ceivable, that would supersede all
objections.

7 incerta . . . excusatum] The
ultimate victor could not blame
Titus very much for not having
taken his side before the victory,
and if Vespasian did take his side
before the victory, he could not
afford to blame Titus at all.
