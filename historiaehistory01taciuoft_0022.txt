xvi INTRODUCTION.

step as to write a book whose motive is sympathy with a man
whom the reigning Emperor put to death for his poetical
republicanism, and calling attention to the fact that his wiser
father had refused to take notice of the offence.

It is indeed evident‚ that though Tacitus felt ill at ease
under the suspicions rule of Domitian, he never came into
direct collision with him, nor excited his displeasure. On the
contrary, his advance was more marked than before 3 in A.D.
88 he was Praetor, and having received, probably at the
same time, a place among the Quindecimviri, he officiated
in the direction of the Secular Games celebrated in that year.
Next year he left Rome, no doubt for a provincial govern-
ment, but we have no evidence what his province was.
Ritter thinks, from Ηὶςί. iv. 82. 1, that he had visited Egypt3
it is true that Egyptian priests were to be found in plenty
nearer home, but perhaps his language there, and in szt. ii.
2. 4, is that of a man who had collected on the spot in-
formation not generally accessible. But it is, as Ritter says,
scarcely possible that he, a Praetorian Senator, should have
administered Egypt, scarcely even that he should have visited
it, under a jealous ruler like Domitian3 see Ann. ii. 59. 4.
A more popular conjecture is, that he held either the Province
of Belgic Gaul (with which he may have had a family con-
nection,—but this would be rather a disqualification than
otherwise in Domitian's eyes) or one of those of the German
frontier, in which, apparently, only one of the legates was
usually of consular rank. It is said in reply to this conjec-
ture, that there were many persons at Rome, or wherever
else Tacitus may have lived, who, having held military or
civil offices in Germany, had opportunity to collect the in·
formation given in Tacitus' book on that country. But
while there were many Romans who had the opportunity
for such observation, it may be doubted if there was any,
