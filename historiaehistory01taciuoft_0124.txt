’Θ re publica] Literally ‘on tlte
side of the national weal ;' e, omitted
by M.‚ is a quite certain correction.

6 occidentium] No one else
could hear, and they did not heed.
Plutarch omits Lecanius's name,
and adds two others. N otice the
way that Tacitus avoids repeating
the fatal blow, which has a rhe-
torical effect, something like that
in Aen. iv. 663—4.

quintae decimae] It was in
Germany, but he was no doubt in
one of the detachments mentioned
in 6. 53 31. 3, 8.

7 tegebatur] 35. 2.

CH. XLII. 1 conscientiam] So
edd., though M. has conscientia ,·

this is of slight weight, as final m
»is usually expressed only by a
flourish over the preceding vowel;
and the change of construction is
perhaps more like Tacitus. Else
the ablative is hardly as absurd
as Orelli considers it; quod might
be a sort of cognate accusative:
‘ whether this were an invention
arising from sear, or a confession
of complicity in the conspiracy.'

huc] ‘ To the latter alternative,
viz„ that:' huc is in fact ante-
cedent to the relative adverb ut3
eo would have been used if the
previous clause had not contained
an antithesis.

3 in poplitem goes with ictu,
not w1th Jacuzt for poples ls always
the back of the lines.

CH. XLIII. 1 Densum] Plu-
tarch calls him Sempronius Indister.
He and Dio make him sacrifice his
lise for Galba, not Piso.
