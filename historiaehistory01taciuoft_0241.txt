tempus, loeus, quodque in re tali difficillimum est, prima vox,
dum animo speS‚ timor, rati0, casus obversantur, egressum
cubiculo Vespasianum pauci militeS, solito adsistentes ordine
ut legatum salutaturi, ‘ Imperatorem ' salutavere. Tum ceteri 2
adcurrere, Caesarem et Augustum et omnia principatus voca-
bula cumulare. Mens a metu ad fortunam transierat In
ipso nihil tumidum, adrogans, aut in rebus novis novum fuit.
Ut primum tantae mutationis obfusam oculis caliginem disjecit,
militariter locutus laeta omnia et affluentia excepit. Namque 3
id ipsum opperiens Mucianus alacrem militem in verba Vespa·

⁴ siani adegit. Tum Antiochensium theatrum ingressus, ubi

illis consultare mos est, concurrentes et in adulationem effusos
adloquitur, satis decorus etiam Graeca facundia, omniumque

quae diceret atque ageret arte quadam ostentator.

cers were deliberating when, where,
and by whom the empire should be
formally offered him, the soldiers
offered it spontaneously.

Imperatorem] They felt most
within their rights in conferring this
title3 in theory they might have
done so without revolting from
Vitellius, as Camillus had borne the
title under Tiberius.

2 omma principatus voeabula]
But apparently not 'nceps itself ε
that it unquestionab y rested with
the Senate to confer.

Rene] Their mind, not his, or
there would be no point in the transi·
tion marked by in ῥύεο.
¹ ad fortunam] To a sense that
they were on the winning side.

mutationis] A not very certain
correction for multitudinis. It is
harsh to speak of a man being

,- blinded by a crowd, but it may be

doubted whether Tacitus was not
capable of so speaking—still more,
whether the conjecture in the text is
the best possible.

multantor . . . excepit] He
received their acclamations with a

short soldier-like speech, and then,
going about other business, found
everything else as favourable as his
own men s temper, and favourable
news streaming in. Laeta omnia
includes more than good news from
a distance, but affluentia specifioe
this, and is explained by describing
the good news from Mucianus.

3 td ipsum] That Vespasian
should be called Imperator by his
own soldiers —who alone could give
the title, according to custom.

ubl ssus consultare mos est] Not
the Athenian custom, but that os
most Greek democracies‚ or states
where there was an Ecclesia at all;
at least in the decline of Greek
political life. We may remember
the meeting at Tarentum, which
precipitated the war of Pyrrhus.

satis decorus . . . ostentator]
The second clause at least is meant
as a questionable compliment—he
was a vain man, though he had too
good taste to make his vanity ridi-
culous. ' Not impossibly the former
is so too ; it was all very well to be

an elegant speaker and a linguist,
