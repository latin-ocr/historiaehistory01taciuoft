in tlze name of the state3' though
one might take it ‘as from the
champion of the public interest. ’

questionable fitness to his person.'
Else one might take it ‘doubtful‚’
i. e. dangerous ‘to himself)

legi] Legere is not quite a technical
term for the chief of the state ‘ levy-
ing ’ soldiers (though such a sense is
implied in legio), but its usage rather
suggests the vir virum legit of 1·8. 3.

claustra. caspiam] The pass
also called Pylae Caspiae, leading
south of the Caspian into the remoter
