CORNELII TACITI

HISTORIARUM

LIBER PRIMUS.

Iun-um mihi operis Servius Galba iterum Titus Vinius
consules erunt. Nam post conditam urbem octingentos et
viginti prioris aevi annos multi auctores rettulerunt, dum res

CH. Ι. 1 Inmum . . . consules
erunt] ‘ ΤΙιε beginning of my work
shall be the consulship of . . .’
In English we should use the abs·
tract word, while in Latin it is
kept in the concrete; a participle
or adjective, or substantive in ap-
ξὲξὲῗέιξῖὶνῖῗᾞιιέἶῖἷῖιῑὶῗοὲὴέε3ἰὲὲὲ
words in 11. 5 presents no diffi-
culty, else the construction is per-
haps commoner in the oblique caseS,
ag. Cic. Phil. xiii. 16. 33 init.,
‘ semri percussos Petrum et Mace-
donum . . . laudastis-,⁹ ‘ Vou ap-
proved of the execution of . . .’
Perhaps the closest parallel to this
particular expression is found in
Greek, ἐνόει χρόνος, Θεμιστοκλῆς
ἄρχων, Aeseh. in Ctes. §62

servius Galba] The Gentile
name Sulpicius is omitted—Servius,
scarcely less than Galba, being char-
acteristic of that house, cf. ii. 47. 5.

iterum] His former consulship
was in ΑΛ). 33, see Ann. vi. 20. 3.
Even if he were not the emperor,
the consul who had held the office
before would be naturally men-

should more naturally mention
what belonged only to one member
of a sentence, in the second member
than in the first. Here we might
translate: ‘the second consulship
of Galba, wz’tlz Τ. Vinius.’

Nam] The connexion is ‘Here
we begin modern history,—modern‚
though not the most recent. The
earlier history has already been
treated ostem—that os the Republic
well, that of the hereditary Caesars
according to men's partialities. In
the period 1 now treat of (that of
the Civil Wars and of the Flavii),
Ι mean to shun all partiality; if I
live to treat of our own happier
times, impartiality will be a choep
and easy virtue.’ ·

octingentos et viginti] 822,
according to the common reckoning.
Either Tacitus follows the other
(commonly called Catonian) chrono-
logy, or he uses a round number.
So again iv. 58. 8, which is spoken
a year later, and so, is anything,
supports the second view. ln
Ann. xiii. 58, the number must be
corrupt or careless ; tradition makes

tioned first, while in English we the Twins found the city when only

’ TAC. 1.
