5 paludamento opertum] Was
he, like Caligula, dressed as a little
soldier? or is it meant that the
father wrapped his own cloak over
the baby? If the former, the use
of the word opertum means that it
looked ridiculous for a baby in arms
to wear such a garment,—he was
lost in it 3 if the latter, it still points
out an absurdity, in the army turn-
ing out to see a child who couldn't
even be held up to them after all.
Vitellius was careful of other people's
comfort as well as his own (see on
i. 52. 1, 3), and was probably akind
as well as a fond father.

Nimius] Not that it was es-
sentially absurd to give a child such
honours, but it was absurd for
Vitellius to be called Germanicus,
(i. 62. 4), and transmit the title to
his son, as though he were another
Drusus.

m solatium] The thought is one
strange to a modern, depending on
the conception of good or evil
fortune as something objective, not
dependent on conscious pleasure or
pain. The poor child was put to
death next year (iv. 81) and to
be murdered in infancy is a mis-

CH. LX. 1 unde . . . exer-estus]
‘ From which more than anything
disaffection to Vitellius spread
through the armies of Illyricum.'
Few of them had been present at
the battle, so that the animosity of
the mass had not been roused:
those who had, had distinguished
themselves, so that the legions did
not feel their honour touched. But
when their best officers were put to
death in cold blood, they had some-
thing to resent.

2 squalidos] In mourning, as
prisoners awaiting trial; it is per·
haps intimated, that they were
designedly kept in suspense, so as
to force them to more and more
abject conduct.

3 Proditionem ultro mputa-
bant] ‘ They voluntarily asserted
their own treason, and made a
merit of it!

fldem absolvit] Not ‘ acquittecl
them of the crime of loyalty’ (C.
and Β.), which would be fidei or
de fide, but ‘acquitted ' (zze. par·
doned) ‘their loyalty’ which they
