3 &dome In its etymological
meaning, an so nearly synonymous
with jacere oscula—though the asso-
ciations of the commonet derived
meaning come in.

damnatione] The most invidious
word for supreme power3 he makes
himself their slave to-day, that they
and their countrymen may be his
slaves for ever.

4 danaorum legio] In 31. 7
we were told they united with the
Praetorians, i.e. marched into their
cam . Now they had not only
reso ved to co-operate with them,
but resolved on the object to co·
operate for.

Cu. XXXVII. 1 commilitones]
Galba was said to be the first
emperor who condescended to call
his men so; this frankness being
the one popular element in his

character. Otho is careful to imi·

tate it; only Tacitus lets us feel
how incongruous it is with him.

sustineo] ‘1 have not the im-
pudence?

being made (32. 1); the soldiers'
eries could be heard in the city
(31. 1), and so no doubt the
citizens’ eries could in the oemp3

according to the precedent men·
tioned in the next sentence.

4 tot mma] According to Dion,
7000 in the first massacre ; but that
must, even before the decimation,
surely be an exaggeration. Com-
pare, however, 6. 3, where Tacitus
uses in his own person the same
words as Otho.
