have the mark of a genuine though rather formal modesty and
courtesy 3 but there is one among Pliny's letters which there
are some grounds for suspecting to be written by him, and
which shares in no small degree Pliny’s characteristic fault of
literary vanity and sels-consciousneSS.

Among the Epistles with the superscription Plinius Tacito
are two, in widely different parts of the collection, which, if
read in connection with each other, must strike every reader
as being presumably by different authors—the second being
written in answer to the first.

In Book i. Ep. 6, the writer tells how he made believe to
be hunting, and actually achieved spearing three boat-S, while
in the intervals he found opportunity to sit down and make
notes for literary work—a notion which he expects his corre-

’ spondent to find comical or incredible‚ but which he propounds

for his serious consideration and imitation, as combining the
service of Minerva and Diana. In the supposed reply,
Book ix· Ep. 10, the writer says that boars are scarce about
him, and Minerva's service has difficulties enough of its own ;
in short, he writes as if he felt the foolishness of affectation
like his friend’S, and declined to have anything to do with it.
Now, if we do admit the second letter to be an answer to the
first, we might be content to suppose that Pliny acted like a
prig, and wrote about it like a prig, and that Tacitus snubbed
him as far as friendship and courtesy would allow 3 but, unfor-
tunately, the second letter is addressed to the author of the
Dialogue ascribed to Tacitus. It contains the sentence, Itaque
poemata qum-cunt, quae tu inter nemora et lucos commodiosime
perfici putas—a manifest reference to TacituS, Dial. 9. 6, poetic,
si modo dthnum aliquid elaborare et efficere velint . . . . ut {psi
debunt, in nemora et lucos, id art, in solitudinem recedendum est.
Now, Pliny cannot have been the author of the Dialogue‚ for he
was barely fourteen‚ not therefore juvemk, when it is supposed
