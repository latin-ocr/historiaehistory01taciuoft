{Js-'z more settled state of the government. The well-known say-

’ j seems separable from the pessimism which was chiefly a

matter of his individual temper; this humanitarian morality,

,ζ ᾖ· which it is hard for a modern to avoid calling Positivism, was
ἶῖ . to all appearance the dominant influence among the better
