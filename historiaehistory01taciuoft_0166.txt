88 CORNELII TACITI

intercidere ac reparari promisca sunt ε aeternitas rerum et pax
gentium et mea curn vestra salus incolumitate senatus firmatur.
Hunc auspicato a parente et conditore urbis nostrae institutum, 10
et a regibus usque ad principes continuum 'et inmortalem,
sicut a majoribus accepimus, sic posteris tradamus. Nam ut
ex vobis senatoreS‚ ita ex senatoribus principes nascuntur.⁷
85 Et oratio ad perstringendos mulcendosque militum animos, et
severitatis modus (neque enim in plures quam in duos anim-
adverti jusserat,) grate accepta, compositique ad praesens qui
coerceri non poterant. Non tamen quies urbis redierat z z
strepitus telorum et facies belli, et militibus ut nihil in commune
turbantibus, ita sparsis per domos occulto habitu, et maligna
cura in omnes, quos nobilitas aut opes aut aliqua insignis
claritudo rumoribus objecerat. Vitellianos quoque milites
venisse in urbem ad studia partium noscenda plerique crede-
bant. Unde plena omnia suspicionum, et vix secreta domuum
sine formidine. Sed plurimum trepidationis in public0‚

intercidere . . . promam

as we might say, ‘The way that
sunt] The verb attracted, by a

justice was tempered with mercy;

conscious Graecism, into a personal
construction; the natural expres-
sion would have been muta ista.
intercidere. ,promiscum est. Μ.
has promisca, without u, and so Or.

10 sieut] Μ has sic, with the
next word manisestly corrupt.
Tacitus' language is too developed
for it to be likely that he puts a
double sic, as Homer would a double
ὡς, to indicate that two processes
were identical, leaving it for later
grammarians to discover that one
is a relative, the other a demon-
strative adverb.

ex senatoribus principes] Such
was necessarily the theory, and
such had hitherto been the practice;
see 29.1 for Otho's own quali-
fication.

CH. LXXXV. 1 severitatis mo-
dus] Both words of commendation,

though the meaning is less that
they were glad he was strict than
that he was not too strict.

2 et mmmm] Balanced by et
malagna cura, which is thus seen to
be an abl. Some have wished to
make the sentence a little easier
and a great deal tamer, by reading
erat sor the former et.

occulto habitu] Hardly as much
as ‘in disguise,' but ‘concealing
their character,' as we should say,
out of uniform. Lipsius quotes
from Epictetus evidence that it was
not unusual for soldiers to act as
spies in plain clothes, but it must
now have been done spontaneously.

maligna] Almost ‘Jealous ;' they
watched them because they grudged
them their distinction.

3 credebant] Perhaps rightly,

75. 1, 2.
