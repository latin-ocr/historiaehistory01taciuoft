preserved, of a whole class of the author's early writings. But
when, after fifteen years' silence, Tacitus begins to write again,
he has broken completely with the Ciceronian tradition. He
has not fallen in with the slighter and more careless structure
of sentence that was becoming common ; he has gone a good
deal beyond it, and yet holds himself aloof from it. No one
could call his style careless or slipshod ; it is only on second
thoughts that one would call it artificial. In a picturesque
passage, he sometimes is really simple ς he often in his most
laboured sentences gives the impression that the end he is
labouring for is simplicity, only he is fastidious about the
purity of the means by which his simple message is to be
conveyed. When Tacitus has once chosen his side, and
determined to rislghmshness or obscurity rather than tedious-

determined in what direction to look for excellence, in that
direction he goeS. Owing to the subject, the Agricola is
naturally more rhetorical, the Germany more poetical, than

say that it is in the Annals that we see Tacitus’ literary art at
its best, it is because there he has room to be most T acitean.
It has been said, that the peculiarities of Tacitus' style may
be all reduced to three—brevitasfflqzjfflffl The
first characteristic is the surest to strike every reader 3 the last
is that the sense of which will grow most upon those who read
observantly and intelligently 3 the second (the habit of varying
constructions in the course of a passage, for the variety's sake)
seems the least closely bound up with the author’s individu-
