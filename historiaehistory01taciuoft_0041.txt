INTRODUCTION. xxxv

‘ in hoc libro quaerit sua dogmata quisque,
Inque hoc inveniet dogmata quisque sua.'
But as we have learnt that Tacitus' lesson is larger than can
be embodied in quotations or conveyed by single examples‚
so we may learn that it is too well considered sor its principles

3‘- to be enunciated in a sentence, or sor its worth to be esti·

mated in inverse proportion to the neatness of the epigram it
inspires· He gives us no doubt half-truthS, but with truth as

Ῐ with material possessionS, the half is osten more than the
' whole3 those have learnt most from him who are most in

sympathy with him, not those who are best able to give
account of their agreement or disagreement with his particular
statements and doctrines, For these reasons, it seems to be
a mistake to attempt to enunciate Tacitus’ political opinions
by collecting in one body all the passages where they seem to
be expressed ς the collection given below, founded on that in
Nipperdey’s Preface, is to be viewed rather as a vivarium in
which his thoughts may be observed, than an anatomical
museum in which they are separately arranged and classified.

2⁶ That Tacitus was heartily loyal to the Senate3 that he was

convinced, without heartineSS, of the necessity of the Empire 3

¹, that while he recognised that the popular element in the old
ἓ republican constitution was deservedly obsolete, he was
. · neither indifferent nor unjust to the popular party in the past ;

’ —so much may be said without risk or error3 but wherever
he seems to express political doctrines with more detail and

ἦ ἀείὶηἰῒειιεεε, we must not forget the possibility that he either

3 states thern dramatically, as being held by the leading
⁵ characters or the populace at the time he is describing‚ or
'5 gives vent to them as the sentiments provoked by his im-
? mediate subject, which must be compared with and balanced

ἵ ¹ by other independent sentiments, before we can be sure (if

 

we ever can> what was his deliberate opinion.
