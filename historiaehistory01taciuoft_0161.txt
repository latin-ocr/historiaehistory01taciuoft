1³1⁵ 1Άὶἰψιζοοειὶισῒιιι·1ο;ιι·αιιι] Only two, says

4 magistratus . . . senesreml-
naeque] Tacitus was not obliged

to make up his mind whether this
was an apposition or an asyndeton ;

equis] Those of the vehicula were
just bandy, as the anns were.

CH. LXXXI. 1 celebre. .-v1
nsque] Eighty senators, says Plu-
tarch. Tacitus clearly means to
describe a decorous state banquet3
but it was perhaps a symptom of a
luxurious head of the state to keep
such late hours as must have been
kept to give the soldiers time to
arrive from Ostia.

. 2 utque . . . mentibus] ‘And
as happens when men’s minds are

. . ;' evertitis present.

3 haud secus . . . territus]
Tacitus would intimate that he
was as innocent of the suspected
treachery in desire as in act.

the senes would, many of them, be
magistratus, and have instgnia to
throw off ; at any rate they, and
even the feminae would have trains
of servants to avoid, but there
were two shocking things, that
both the official respect due to
rank, and the natural raepect due
to age or sex, were forgotten or
turned to shame.

ut . . . mens] Parallel to ami-
corum, in fact equivalent to clientum
ut cuique quisque humillimus erat,
‘the humblest of their clients that
each of them could think of. '

incertas] ‘jobscure not ‘Junsase
