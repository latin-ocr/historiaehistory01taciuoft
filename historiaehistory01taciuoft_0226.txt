148 CORNELII TACITI

tum per epistolaS, vitata Flaminiae viae celebritate, devertere
Interamnium atque ibi interfici jussit. Longum interfectori 2
visum : in itinere ac taberna projectum humi jugulavit, magna
cum invidia novi principatus, cujus hoc primum specimen
noscebatur. Et Triariae licentiam modestum e proximo ex· 3
emplum onerabat, Galeria imperatoris uxor, non inmixta tristi-

65 Digressum a Lugduno Vitellium M. Cluvius Rufus adse-
quitur, omissa Hispania, laetitiam et gratulationem voltu ferens,
animo anxius, et petitum se criminationibus gnarus. Hilarius, 2

2 1n mnere ac taberna] In an
inn beside the Flaminian road,
while still ostensibly going to meet
Vitellius.

noscebatur] Of course in the

having married his former wife
Vipsania. But Tiberius had di-
vorced her very much against his
will, and if she had remained
unmarried would probably have

taken her back 3 and the husband
of the daughter of Agrippa might
be thought to connect himself with
the imperial family. According to
Merivale’s suggestion, the marriage
of Silius and Messalina was only
a similar case. It is difficult to see
how either motives of affection or
policy could have weight with
Vitellius ; but it is not unintelligible
that he should have felt a sort of
brutal and irrational jealousy.
Apparently Petronia had sons by
both her husbands: according to
Suetonius, Vitellius put his own son
Petronianus to death—which seems
incredible.

vocatum . . . jussit] He sent
a summons to Dolabella to meet
him, with orders to his conductor to
take him aside and kill him.

Interamnium] Oftener Inter-
amna, iii. 61. 2, 63. 2.

than at the roadside.

4] Dio and Suetonius give (with
slight variations) the same story:
the latter seems to understand her
words as apprehending Nemesis,

‘ flattery from the citizens,' though
it may mean the temptations af-
forded by power to influence them.

tantum adversa] She died
however before the final fall of her
sons, iii. 67. 2. There was a foolish
story that Vitellius had her starved.

CH. LXV. 2 caesaris] Must
mean Vitellius, in spite of 62. 3. It
was the natural expression, when
