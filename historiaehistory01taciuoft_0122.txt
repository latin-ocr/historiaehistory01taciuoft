Agitasse Laco ignaro Galba de occidendo Tito Vinio dicitur,2

Othonis credebat, ad postremum vel odio. Haesitationem 3
attulit tempus ac locus, quia initio caedis orto difficilis modus.
Et turbavere consilium trepidi nuntii ac proximorum diffugia,
languentibus omnium studiis qui primo alacres fidem atque
40 animum ostentaverant. Agebatur huc illuc Galba, vario turbae
fluctuantis inpulsu, completis undique basilicis ac templis,
lugubri prospectu. Neque populi aut plebis ulla vox, sed 2

could not say redire censeo for re·
dcundum censeo ; but Tac. has not
made up his mind what verb he
will use.

occupanda] ‘Secure,' before the
mutineers came up.

plerique . . . plures] Of the
three parties who gave any posi-

porters; secondly, he saw that the
people were beginning to desert,
and lost his presence of mind
too completely to do anything.

diffugia] ‘'Aa-a} λεγόμενον.

CH. XL. 1 huc mue] ‘From
side to side.' The hearers of the
chair, no doubt, kept the general

tive advice, those who recommended
the Rostra were largest ; but those
who confined themselves to op·
posing everything were more
numerous than all three.

2 poena] Perhaps *best taken as
ablative.

vel] As in 33. 4, we see the
transition between the two ap-
parently distinct meanings of this
particle. Else one might say that
the two first hypotheses (sive . . .
seu) are grouped together and con-
trasted with the third. He may
have thought of it from policy (and
that on one of two grounds) or
merely from personal ill-will.

3 Laco had two reasons for not
killing Viniu53 first, he was afraid
it might be taken as an act of
treason to Galba, and a signal for
the massacre of him and his sup-

direction they intended, but had to
push their way through the crowd,
and could not go fast or straight.
lugubri prospectu] ‘Thronged
with spectators of this moumful
ΞὲῆἶὶῒᾈεξεῃέἓῖῃΒἐιεωὲἳέηὲὴῗηέἳξ
absolute, ‘the sight before them
being a moumful one.² If this
seems harsh or obscure, the sense
must be, ‘Galba from his chair
had a discouraging prospect,' seeing
every one crowd round to see what
happened, but every one who was
expected to help him edge away.

2 populi aut plume] There was
not the utterance of a great nation
in its lawful assembly, nor even the
shouting of a promiscuous crowd:

populus and plebs are the same per-

sons regarded in different lights.
