Galba. Ves asian's own family was
undistinguis ed, and he ridiculed
all attempts to make it appear other-
wise; there were however some
Flavii of whom we hear as sar back
as B.c. 328, and Ap. Claudius'
famous secretary, not many years
later, might be said to give the name
some distinction. Vespasian had
very likely as good a right to the
imago of that patriarch of novi
homines, as the Bruti of Caesar's
time to that of the founder of the
Re ublic.
quo ponsa viden concupisse]
Nearly every one rightly agrees in
rejectmg the conjecture non cupis-se,
but the phrase as it stands is arguta
sententia (Or.) He and most in-
terpreters say that the emphasis is
on videri, ‘ the time is past when you
could be thought to have coveted
empire3’ -now you must be known
to covet it. But videri is hardly so
confined to the meaning of doubtfid

member is suppressed. It would
be easier to lay the stress on posses
—‘ the time is past when you could
afford to be thought to have coveted ’
what you could not be suspected of
aiming at. But neither of these
seems to bring out the force of the
erf. inf. so well as one might
y paraphrasing videri aliquando
potuisti concupisse: nunc non potest
fieri quin videaris concupiscere!

exunt] Sc. mente.

metatus] Strictly s eaking, he
was made to kill himself.>

splendidior. . . sumna] Scarcely
than a Licinius Mucianus, but the
speaker artsully affects to unite his
own case with that os his friend.
Corbulo was perhaps the adopted
son of the praetorian senator of
Ann. iii. 31. 43 by birth he was
brother to Caesonia, the last wife of
the emperor Gaius. It seems that
Tacitus hints here that there were
grounds sor Nero's suspicions of
him; the usual accounts represent
him as strictly and even extm-
vagantly loyal.

7 Etposse. . . neri] Cf. i. 42.

Galbae omo] By the men's hatred
to Galba, not Galba's to Vitellius,
of which we never hear.

8 Ne othonem quidem . . . mag·
num prinoipem fecit] The two
sentiments‚ that it was no credit to
Vitellius to have beaten Otho, and
that he had surpassed him in vices,

‘are run into one sentence in a way

not ungrammatical‚ but rather awk-
ward. As usual, the force of the
sentence is expressed rather by its
order than by its construction. It
happens that in English we oen
make it a little more symmetrioel
without recasting it. ‘Even Otho ·
he defeated not by generalship or
armed force . . . , and even him
he has now made men regi-et as a
great emperor.'
