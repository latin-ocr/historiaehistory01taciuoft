xlviii INTRODUCTION.

prove, that he was kindly and upright in the relations which
he valued so highly—a man such as he describes Helvidius
Priscus, civis, senator, maritus, gener, amicus, cunctas· vitae
qfficz‘is aequabilis. The way that Pliny speaks of him and to
him likewise suggests that he was a good ands amiable man:
and it is something, that all the evidence we have as to his
character should be favourable, even when the evidence is
mainly his own, and that of a friend given to effusive compli-
ments. But this evidence is supported by the whole spirit of
his writings—not less in what he does not say than in what he
does. A man with any capacity for generous feeling might
assume the tender and affectionate tone of the Agricola, but
no one could keep up to the moral elevation and purity of the
historical works‚ unless it were genuine and native to him.
With regard to the vices of his time, and the worse times
before him, his language and his reticence are alike manly
and honourable. In the Hz‘storzks, at least the extant portion,
there is not a sentence that offends against modern delicacy,
not to say natural decency3 and the whole range of contem-
porary literature (with one or two exceptions‚ notably Quinti-
lian, but not excepting even such amiable and respectable
men as Pliny and Statius) shows that this was a characteristic
of the individual, not of the age.¹

In regard to the ‘minor morals’ and social habits of the
man, there is a little evidence which, if admitted, has rather
an unfavourable tendency. The words of Tacitus referred to
by Pliny (Ep. viii. 7. 1), and already quoted (Life, etc. , p. xii),

¹ Dr. Merivale (Hist. of the Romans under the Empire, c. 64) suspects
Tacitus of writing light or immoral verses, because the grammarian
Fulgentius quotes ‘ Cornelius Tacitus in libro facetiarum.' But the

Ἰ passage quoted is very harmless prose (about a son being the epitaph of

his father's virtues), and Ritter is doubtless right in supposing that the
quotation means, not that Tacitus wrote or compiled a jest-book, but that
a saying of his was inserted in one.
