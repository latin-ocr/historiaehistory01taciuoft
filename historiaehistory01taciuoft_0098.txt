CH. XV. 1] Galba perhaps held
himself dispensed from these forma-
lities—-as Pontg'fhx Maximus from
the presence of his colleagueS, as
chief of the state from the (long
since merely formal) assent of the
representatives of the born citizens;
though Augustus at the adoption
of his grandsons had scrupulously
observed all the antiquarian cere·
monies. As Galba was of an old
patrician house, the mention of a
lex curiata in his case throws no
light on the vexed question whether
the curtae wele to the last ex-
clusively patrician bodies.

egreg1um erat] The past in-
dicative of what is not the case,
like dignus eram in the following
chapter.

Lutatiae] Sc. nobilitatis. Gal-
ba's mother was the daughter of 3

Lutatius Catulus, though herself

called Mummia Achaica after another
distinguished ancestor.

2 Nunc . . . vocatum] The
sentiment is, ‘If I were a private
man I might well select you for my
heir on family grounds. as it is, I
am bound to do so on public?

amor patriae does not go with
tua, but means Galba’ s own.

majores nostri] Galba' s great-

grandfather had served under Caesar ¹ .

against Pompey—though he was
said to be one of the conspira-
tors against Caesar, and certainly
fought in the senatorial army at
Mutina.

3 socios belli alludes to Otho.
