that Piso was chosen, ‘which they
had failed to repress‚ they,’ the
camarilla officially acquainted with
it, ‘ spread all the more by trying
to crush it.'

CH. XVIII. 1 ultra solitum]
For of course some bad weather
was to be looked for at that time of
year. And in a Mediterranean
climate, thunder in January would
be no more surprising than rain3
see Hdt. iv. 28. 3, 4.

2 comitiis dirimendis] Of course
it was natural, assemblies being in
the open air3 the origin was not
superstitious, only if the weather
interrupted an assembly, it was
natural to suppose that the gods
meant it to be interrupted. Galba
ought, Tacitus thinks, to have
treated so important an adoption as
official public business, transacted
with the nation in its constitutional
assembly, If he had made the
announcement pro rostris, it perhaps
would technically have been so;
but the Praetorians cannot have
formed a comitia centuriata as the
old civic army did. And Galba
thought that soldiers ought not to

ac silentium,
1v1 nec ssitatem bello

mind the weather when their com·
mander called them. For the
concluding sentiment, cf. A nn.
vi. 22 ς it may be aquestion whether
the doubt is Galba's or Tacitus’s
own, i.e. whether seu . . . vitantur
is an alternative to ut fortuitorum or
to contemptorem talium ; probably
the latter.

imperatoria] Like a general
giving orders to his soldiers, not a
magistrate conducting an official
nomination.

3 quo vir virum legeret] A
technical phrase, of a man choosing
a comrade for a special (usually a
hazardous) service Cic. Mil. xxi. 5 5,
Liv. ix, 39, x, 38.

4 unoetvicesimam] Not duo·
devicesimam; the 18th legion was
one of those destroyed with Varus,
and it would have been held un·
lucky to call a newly raised one by the
same name. This legion was the 22d
Primigenia ; there was also another
22d Deiotarina‚ now stationed (v. 1.
3) at Alexandria.

5 usurpatam. . . necessitatem]
Which precedent had established

as a matter of course.
