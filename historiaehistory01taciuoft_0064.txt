III.—STYLE AND LANGUAGE OF TACITUS.

We have above drawn a distinction between Tacitus' char·
acter as a philosophical historian and as a literary artist3 there
is less sear of dispute as to his merits in the latter character
than in the former, and less question where they are shown in
the highest perfection. It may be doubted whether TacituS,
as he grew older, grew a more candid historian or a more
judicious political thinker : but it is not doubtful that he grew
a greater writer. The dramatie liveliness of the Dialogue
makes it in some ways the pleasantest reading of any of his
works‚ as it is the smoothest, and, apart from corruptions of>
the text, the easiest. He never surpassed, in eloquence and
pathOS, the opening and closing chapters of the Agricola ,· the
Germany is unequalled, in all ancient literature, for the'pure
scientific spirit 3 and some may think the ffl'stories superior to
the Annals for candid and natural pictures of characters and
events, But scarcely any one will deny that the Annals is, on
the whole, his greatest work.1 Although the eccentricity and

¹ Whether it was, as it appears to us, his longest work, is a very difficult
question. Our only evidence as to the respective length of the Annals
and Hzirtorzks is a saying of St. Jerome's (Comm. in Zach. iii. 14),
Cornelius quoque (besides Josephus) Tacitus, qui post Augustum usque ad
mortem Domitiani Vitas Caesarum trigy'nta voluminibus exaravit. If we
admit St. Jerome's accuracy in this passage, it will follow that in the
editions of his time, as in our second Medicean MS.-which‚ itself of the
eleventh century, represents a recension of the fourth—the Annals and
