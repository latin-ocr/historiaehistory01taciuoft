lx INTRODUCTION.

among the RomanS. It is suggested, that the two professed
rhetoricians there introduced, Secundus and Aper (Messala,
though a speaker, is also something more), are meant as
representatives of two rival schools of style; Secundus, of
whom enemies said, non promptum esse sermonem, and friends
that purus et pressus et, in quantum satis erat, profluens sermo
non defuit, will represent the periodie style, of which Cicero
was the great example 3 Aper, whom the world judged ingenio
potius et vi naturae quam institutione et literis famam eloquentiae
consecutum, but who, as his admiring disciple thought, omni
eruditione imbutus, contemnebat potius literas quam nesciebat
(2. 1 fin. 2), will represent the detached, sententious, or
incisive style of the Silver Age. The imitation of Cicero,
preached by Quintilian and practised by Pliny, was not
dominant nor perhaps altogether popular in the last quarter
of the first century A.D. A style which some might call more
vigorous, and others less correct, had come into use, and had
in its favour at least the advantage of novelty 3 even apart
from this, it had the qualities that gain applause‚ and serve to
electrify the groundlin gs. Quintilian felt the distinction between
the old school and the new to be one between true and false
art, Tacitus, on the contrary, thinks either form of art legiti-
mate, and inquires only how it is that the works of art are not
by any method brought up to the old standard of excellence.
For the present, he appears in the conservative or Ciceronian
camp. The Dialogue is, in its whole conception, imitated
from those of Cicero on rhetorical subjects; as in Cicero,
the interlocutors make speeches instead of conversing,
though there are more, or more successful, attempts than in
Cicero to maintain colloquial ease and dramatic propriety.

We cannot tell whether the extant Dialogue is a tour de force
to show that he also, like Aper, contemnebat potius literas quam
nesciebat, or whether it is only a single specimen, accidentally
