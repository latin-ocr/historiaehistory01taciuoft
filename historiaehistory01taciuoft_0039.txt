Scott3 Republicanism, like Jacobitism, had sunk from the
level of a matter of party, and become a matter of sentiment.
But these successive changes of temper are not, to any
perceptible extent, accompanied by changes of opinion. The
hankering after Republicanism as an ideal, while acknowledg·
ing the Empire as a necessity, and, when the author wrote,
a beneficent one,—the feeling that, as Roman greatness was
gained under the leadership of the Senate, so the Senate had
a prescriptive right to its dignity being preserved, while yet
it is clearly acknowledged that the Senate has lost its power
of directing the government, and is tacitly confessed that it
has lost its fitness also,—these are the views or the sentiments

, of the Dialogue, the ffi‘stories, and the Annals alike. There

is some difference in the way that they are conceived‚ or at
least expressed ς in the Dialogue we hear less of the Senate
and more of the position held by its leading members 3 but
this is sufficiently to be accounted sor by the subject and form
of the work 3 it is only in the choice of subject, if anywhere,
that we trace the influence of the youth, the ambition, or the
habits and prospects of the author.

At first sight, this craving aster an ideal confessed to be
unattainable seems a weakness; but it is closely connected
with Tacitus' chief merit as a historian of the Roman polity.
He looks upon the history of Rome as continuous: the
Caesarian revolution that culminated aster Actium makes a
great epoch in that history,—but it is an epoch in the history
that began with the kings, not the commencement of a new
history on the site of the old. The value and significance of
this historical method of viewing contemporary politics seems
to have grown upon the historian 3 it certainly was not peculiar
to him, but was a result of the traditions of the order
and nation he belonged to,—the aspect of their greatness
by which he as a historian was most influenced. In the
