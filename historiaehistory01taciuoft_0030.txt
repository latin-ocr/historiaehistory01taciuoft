xxiv INTRODUCTION.

in September3 according to custom, he claimed the office
of Consul in the ensuing January3 he selected for his col-
league the aged Verginius Rufus. It seems foolish to speak
of this as an act of courage, or even a proof of exceptional
confidence 3 it was not likely that the honourable soldier,
who at fifty-four had twice refused the role of a military
pretender when forced upon him by an enthusiastic soldiery‚
but had lent his loyal services to every successive govern-
ment that had any claim to be called legitimate or national,
should, thirty years later, rebel against a better, and better
founded government than any, when the soldiers had had
all that time to forget him. But the appointment was a
marked compliment, honourable to both giver and receiver,
even if not of much political significance. The old man died
in his well-deserved dignity. He had retained to the last the
active habits of a soldier, and the tastes of a scholar and
speaker,—the last being the more remarkable, because he was
not of a noble family in which literary traditions were heredit-
ary. Reading a large book, standing, he dropped it, and fell

in trying to recover it 3 he broke his thigh-bone, and it scarcely 3=

needs Pliny’s explanation of bad surgery to account for his
death ensuing.

Tacitus was nominated to the vacant dignity, and thus ,

attained the highest official distinction open to a Roman,
short of the Principate itself—-the collegium Caesarzzcff The
first act of his Consulship, the only one recorded, and doubt-

less the most important, was his pronouncing the funeral j
oration of his predecessor3 Pliny says that to be so celebrated

after death was the only thing wanting to complete the happi- .
ness of Verginius' life. Tacitus’ office can hardly have lasted 4
more than a few weeks 3 there is no evidence that Nerva had
altered the custom according to which consuls were appointed
