statim exceperat fama et tunc aperiebat. Nec quiequam

that the god cannot have been so
called, unless from the feeling quis
deus incertum est ,· habitat deus:
people sacrificed to the God of
Carmel, whoever he might be. The
mountain is almost certain, from its
position, to have been a Canaanite
sanctuary3 it was an Israelite one
(1 Kings xviii. 30) at some unknown
time before Ahab, and remained so
(2 Kings iv. 23) for some time after·
wards 3 and is to this day visited
for an annual sacrifice by the Druses.
The absence of image or temple
points to the continuous antiquity
of the worship ; but inspectis . . extzlr
proves that it was not now Judaic,
nor, it may be added, in the common
historical sense, Samaritan. It is
however as likely to have been
derived from some of Esarhaddon's
colonists as from the Phoenician

aborigines3 the Greek name of the
priest proves nothing.

CH. LXXIX. 1 haec Judaeae
caput est] The civil capital of the
province ; in v. 8. 1 he accurately
says Hinosolyma genti caput. -

Initium . .
phus (B. J. iv. 10. 6) says that he
only proclaimed Vespasian on, hear-
ing from him that he had been pro-
claimed in Judaea. And Suetonius
makes the latter take place on the
11th (quinto Idus) instead of the 3d
of July. As to this at least, Tacitus
is admitted to be certainly right.

2 non parata contione] An abl.
abs„ ‘without the men being got
together to hear an address,' as ap-
pears from the symmetry of con·
junctis legionibus.
