obsistunt. Undique arma et minae, modo in centuriones 2
tribunosque, modo in senatum universum, lymphatis caeco
pavore animis, et quia neminem unum destinare irae poterant,

redieruntque in castra inviti neque innocentes. Postera die 3
velut capta urbe clausae domus, rarus per vias-populus, maesta
plebs 3 dejecti in terram militum voltus, ac plus tristitiae quam
paenitentiae. Manipulatim adlocuti sunt Licinius Proculus et 4
Plotius Firmus praefecti, ex suo quisque ingenio mitius aut
horridius. Finis sermonis in eo ut quina milia nummum
singulis militibus numerarentur. Tum Otho ingredi castra 5

praefecto legium] We never
hear of officers with this title else-
where in Tacitus, whence some
desire to strike out legionis ,· but
there are no traces of corruption

present period, it might account for
his being so rarely heard of. Τὴε

3 populus . . . plebs] See on
35. 1, 36. 2, and especially

4 Finis sermonis in eo ut] The
conclusion the speeches worked up
to, what they finally came to, was
that . . .

5 Tum] When the donative had
been promised.

mffltlae mig-subus] Cf. militiae
. . . honorem, Juv. vii. 88, which
indicates what the tribunes’ insignia
were, the clavus and ring, like those
of equites. There seems no evi-
dence that the centurions had any
other insignia than the invidious
one of the vitis.

CH. LXXXIII. 1 quamquam
. . . postremo] The connexion of
thought seems to be, ‘ Otho was in
a difficult position, but this speech
was his way out of it.' Tacitus
states the difficulty of either a
strict or a lax course, first from the
point of view of his hearers, then
from his own. ‘Oth0, in spite of
