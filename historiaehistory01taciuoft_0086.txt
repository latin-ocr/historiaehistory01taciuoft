events cannot be affiliated to it, or
to any assignable cause.

2 gaudentium impetu] We
should say, ‘the first transport of
men's joy ;' in Latin, as usual, a
concrete expression is preferred to
an abstract.

aut. . . aut] Almost‘ among
the senate, the people, and the
army respectively.'

conciverat] Joined by a rather
harsh zeugma with the two dis-
similar accusatives, vam'os motus
animorum and omnes legiones duces-
que: ‘had roused, not only various
feelings in the city, . . . but the
legions and their commanders also.'
And the harshness is inereased by
the unsymmetrical position of non
modo . . . sed; in fact Tacitus had
begun as though he meant to write
varios motus animorum non modo zn
urbe.. . sed inter legiones ducesque
conciverat. Then it occurred to him
that the armies were aroused, not their
feelings only ; and so he omitted the
preposition in the latter clause, with-
out altering the former to suit it.

posse . . . fleri] This was the
absolute novelty ; else Claudius had
been appointed by the army, before
the senate' s consent was asked or
extorted.

3] ‘But the Fathers rejoiced,
having felt the less restraint in
asserting their liberty when the
emperor they had to deal with was
a new one, and absent.'

per clientelas, per

usurpata . . . erga. is not
quite ⁴ asserted against,' for erga
is almost always of friendly rela-
tions ; still the assertion or exercise
qu liberty implies a person to be free
rom.

pars populi integra] Probably
in apposition to clientes libertique
damnatorum, the latter being epex-
egetical of magnis domibus adnexa.
It is indeed quite possible that the
two classes, though partly identified,
are not meant to be co·extensive, ·
but it is needless and harsh to
assume an asyndeton. The uncor-
rupted part of the people was
preserved from corruption by having
some tie to the national honour,
and the most general tie was con-
nexion with great houses, and the
commonest connexion was clientela
(though Or. is relevant on adnexa,
‘van'as per necessitudines ut puta
procurationes
redituum ac latifundiorum, per
rem etiam fenebrem '). Again, most
great houses had had their chief
members condemned, so that clientes
libertique damnatorum would form,
if not the whole of the pars populi
integra, its largest and best defined
section. The only peculiarity is,
that Tacitus should speak of clients,
and even freedmen, in such honour-
able terms; but historians do not
feel this difficulty as editors seem
to do. He is talking of the city
population only,-and there a poor
