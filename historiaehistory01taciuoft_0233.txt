mentum fabulae assumpto, volgus credulum et quidam militum,

condicione fugitivus, nomine Geta, sumptum de eo supplicium

in servilem modum.

ἶ 73 Vix credibile memoratu est quantum superbiae socordiaeque

Vitellio adoleverit, postquam speculatores e Suria Judaeaque

adactum in verba ejus Orientem nuntiavere.

Nam etsi vagis 2

adhuc et incertis auctoribuS, erat tamen in ore famaque Vespa-
sianuS, ac plerumque ad nomen ejus Vitellius excitabatur.
Tum ipse exercitusque, ut nullo aemulo, saevitia, libidine,

74 raptu in externos mores proruperant. At Vespasianus bellum

armaque, et procul vel juxta sitas vires, circumspectabat.

the latter, or perhaps an imaginary
younger brother, supposed to have
taken alarm from their fate. From
the combination of the names Scri-
bonianus and Crassus, we may guess
that the elder Camerinus had
married a sister of Piso Licinianus
—see the genealogy on i. 14. 2.
Piso's ado tion by Galba had served
to keep t e family before men’s
eyes, and this decided the slave as
to which of Nero’s victims he should
connect himself with.

2 usamentum rabulae] ‘ Ad-
mitted into the plot of the piece,’
ἐι. allowed to know it so as to make
sure of their acting their own parts
harmoniously.

mortalium] The word is used in
a similar expletive way in,Agr. 11.
1. It seems merely to indicate
utter uncertainty, as we say, ‘ Who
on earth? there is nothing there to

int to legends of supernatural in-
ffibitants, nor here to bring out the

saroesm, that Camerinus had been
killed once, so that if this was he,
he must have more lives than one.

condicione fugitivus] rap·
ὑπόνοιαν : condicione servus would
have been natural enough; but
this pretender to nobility not only
belonged to the lowest class os
society—he had sunk even below
that, by dishonesty.

Cn. LXXIII. 1 speculatores]
In the usual technical sense:

⁸ members of the emperor's body·

guard were his natural messengers
on military business.
2 plerumque . . .

The verb is rather a strong one.
Vitellius was habitually absorbed
in the pleasures of the moment—it
always needed something to rouse
him from his torpor: but hearing
the name ofVespasian was generally
enough to do so.

in externos mores] Those of an
oriental court, as in 70. 3.

exaltabatur]
