19. 4). Pompey is thought to have
married Julia ‘ for love, and does
not seem to have had any ersonal
regard for her father3 ut the
successive marriages of the other
Julia, Augustus' daughter, illus-
trate the way that a man’s political
inheritance was ordinarily devolved.
There is a similar significance in
the marriages of Gracchus and
Priscus before referred to; perhaps
one might add the cases of Laelius
and Scaevola, of Agricola and
Tacitus himself.

‘Compelled suicides,’⁶so infr. 72. 5,
Ann. xi. 37. 4, and necessitas ultima
in Ann. xv. 61 fin. Tacitus
abounds in euphemistic paraphrases
for suicide‚—Just as the Japanese
Hara kin· is said now to be
thought a coarse expression, and
it has been superseded by another
word. In fact, imperial Rome
and modern Japan are almost

this must mean populi Romani,
else one might more naturally
take it in a general sense, ‘of us
men.’ The relation of nostram to
ultibnem is obscure; is it ‘ venge-
ance on us ' or ‘ vengeance for us ’?
If Lucan is a sure parallel, he will
decide for the latter view.

CH. IV. 1] ‘ But before 1 set
in order the work proposed sor my
task, 1 think it necessary to retrace
the question, how the capital stood,
how the armies were affected, how
the provinces were disposed3 what
elements of strength or weakness
there were in the whole world, that
a view may be gained, not only of
circumstances and events, which
are generally accidental, but of the
pervading principle and reasons’
The sense of the last clause is,—
one can trace a principle in the
general outline and tendency of the
history of a period; but particular
