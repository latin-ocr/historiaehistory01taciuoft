The word is used there also, but it
seems to mean merely ‘a selected
foree‚' not in any technical sense
‘ a corps d ’elna’

3 Amulio] No doubt a gentile
name, the resemblance to the
mythical one being perhaps acci-
dental; M. writes it with a double
l. Yet mythical praenomina (like
Julus Antonius) were not un-
known.

Germanicos] Of course not
‘German soldie1·s,' but ‘of the
army of Germany.' From the
national name Germani is derived
the geographical name Germania,
and from this the adjective Ger-
manicus ; and the first and last are
never confounded‚ nor is analogy
often transgressed in the formation
of such words.

4] Supr. 6. 3.

5 praetorianorum in sense goes
with both castra and tribuni, in
construction (according to the usual
Latin order of words) probably
with the latter. Probably the legio
classica, like the German and Illy·

rian troops, was not in a regular
cam . -

ngcdum i.q. nondum is silver-
'age; in older Latin et would not
be wanted.

6 qma non . . . erat] ‘Because, ·
not on account of his military rank,
but of his belonging to the number
of Galba's friends, he was . . .'
Orelli seems to take ordine militiae
and e Galbae amicis not as explana-
tions of his conduct, but of that of
the soldiers; it seems clearer to
make the ablative clauses account
for his conduct, and quia for theirs.
ΤΙιε sense is, that the Officers had
no higher sense of allegiance than
the men, ——it was a matter of course
that they should protest against a
mutiny, but they would submit,
after a decent protest, to the show
of force ι real force was only needed
to overcome private friendship.
But in 36. 2 we are told that
the officers did generally adhere to
Galba, or at least are suspected of it.
