CORNELII TACITI

duae legiones congressae sunt, pro Vitellio unetvicesima, cui

cognomen Rapaci, vetere gloria insignis3 e parte Othonis
prima Adjutrix, non ante in aciem deducta, sed ferox et novi

decoris avida.

been cleared by an inundation (like
that of Virg. Georg. i. 481-3) or left
bare for fear of one, or was it even
then below the level of the em-
banked river, and so too damp for
vines ⁴?

vetere gloria] They had served
through Germanicus' campaigns,
and apparently had been on the
German frontier ever since. No
doubt they had also taken part in

the defeat of Vindex.
non ante . . . deducta] They

were the legion enrolled from the
fleet—-the classica of i. 31. 4, 7 ; see
ii. 11. 4, where they start from
Rome.

2 principiis] What would in the
old republican army have been
called the hastati and principes—the
antepilanz' of Liv. viii. 8. Though
Marius had abolished the distinc-
tion of arms and seniority between
the three divisions of the legion,
there remained not only the tradition
of fighting in three lines, but the
names of the bodies, as giving
title to their respective centurions.
Hence we find the eagle kept in its

old place—behind all except what
used to be the reserve3 but each
ordo had a szgrnum of its own3 cf.
111. 22. .
3 quisntanorum] Vitellian, i. 55.
2 etc.

⁹ quartadecimani] The most dis-
tinguished engaged on Otho's side,
11. 2. ; but it was only their vexil-
larii who had yet come up (ib. and
66. 1.) The First and they are, in

probably to understand that they
were successful until surrounded
and hopelessly outnumbered.

firmabant] The force of the tense
is ‘ lee’re on th'e spot, doing general's
wor .

4 navibus transvectum] Tbey
saw the battle begun, and probably
the men at work on the bridge
drawn off ; but the Batavians (who
were doubtless included among the
Germani of c. 35) had been left to
watch them, and were set at liberty
by their rash advance.

CH. XLIV. 1 media acie] On
the road, and a little north of it.
