CORNELII TACITI

initium illic fuit: ne plus quam semel certemuS, penes me

exemplum erit.

Hinc Othonem posteritas aestimet.

F ruetur 4

Vitellius fratre, conjuge, liberis: mihi non ultione neque

solatiis opus est.

Alii diutius imperium tenuerint : -nemo tam

fortiter reliquerit. An ego tantum Romanae pubiS, tot egregios
exercitus sterni rursus et rei publicae eripi patiar? Eat hic 5

mecum animus, tanquam perituri pro me fueritis.
N ec diu moremur, ego incolumitatem vestram,

superstites.

Sed este

vos constantiam meam. Plura de extremis loqui pars ignaviae 6⁴
est. Praecipuum destinationis meae documentum habete,
quod de nemine queror: nam incusare deos vel homineS, ejus

48 est qui vivere velit.’ Talia locutus, ut cuique aetas aut

dignitas, comiter appellatos, irent propere neu remanendo
iram victoris asperarent, juvenes auctoritate, senes precibus
movebat, placidus ore, intrepidus verbis, intempestivas suorum

lacrimas coercens.

Dari naves ac vehicula abeuntibus jubet,

libellos epistolasque studio erga se aut in Vitellium contumeliis
insignes abolet ,- pecunias distribuit, parce, nec ut periturus.

4 fratre, conjuge, liberis] He
does not mention his mother, who
was also at Rome, i. 75. 3, 4

non ultione neque solatiis] Some·
times taken as almost a hendiadys,
‘ The consolations of revenge 3' per-
haps rather a transition to the next
sentence, ‘ I have no need of
revenge on my enemy, nor conso-
lation for my short reign—the
character of its end is consolation
enough!

Romanae pubis] See i. 84 sq.‚
and note. In these words he treats
them (pubes being a more poetical
equivalent for juventus) as a civic
force, able to appreciate patriotism 3
then exercitus appeals to their pro-
fessional military pride and sense
of their value to the whole empire.
Plutarch's version of Otho's speech
is quite different; but this senti-
ment is represented by his phrase,
καλῶς ἀποθανεῖν ὑπέρ τοσούτων καὶ

τοιούτων πολιτῶν 3· as he also says,
‘rap’ ἡμῖν καὶ τέκνα τῶν πολεμίων καὶ
γυναῖκες, perhaps the two historians
had some materials which each
worked into his fancy composition.

5 Eat mc, etc.] ‘ Let me die
with the same feeling as if you were
going ' (not ‘in the belief that you
are willing') ‘to die for me; but
do not die with me.'

Nec . . . meam] ‘ And now let
me no longer hinder you from being
safe' (as you will when I am dead
and Vitellius has no rival), ‘ while
you no longer delay my resolution‚'
by your entreaties, from being
carried out in act.

6 do nemine queror] ‘ I ascribe
the defeat neither to cowardice nor
treachery, and do not complain of
fortune! It is the second supposition
that he is most anxious to exclude.

CH. XLVIII. 2 naves] For
crossing the Po.
