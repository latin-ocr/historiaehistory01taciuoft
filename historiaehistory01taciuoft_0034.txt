to his friend's works, we shall see that he (and indeed the
same is true of most Latin writers, historians included)
regards the ‘immortality' as due to the work of art3 scarcely

political philosophy. Nearly all editors ascribe the mutilated
condition in which Tacitus' great works have reached us, to
his never having been a popular author3 and his want of
popularity was probably owing to his great merits, which
were scarcely appreciated in his own age, being forgotten
among men on whom his minor merits produced less effect
than they then had. It is supposed to be a symptom of public
neglect, that his descendant, the Emperor, thought it necessary
to multiply copies of his works under official patronage 3 and
the shortness of his reign makes it¹ improbable that many
of these official copies were ever produced. Nor can we
be sure that the order for their production indicates a real

being valued for a purpose, not unworthy, but of transitory
interest. Under the circumstances of Tacitus' accession, it
would be possible to appeal to his namesake's works as a
party support, strengthening and justifying his position as in
accordance with constitutional precedent. But never after—
scarcely ever before, since the historian's own time—did the
