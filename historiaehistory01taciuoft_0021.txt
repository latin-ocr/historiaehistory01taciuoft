1 tter to her aunt. How many children were born is not
rKcorded 3 Nipperdey infers that there were none at Agricola’s
death, because none are mentioned in Agr. 46. 3. If he is
right, the descendants whom Tacitus undoubtedly left must
have been by a second wife, or by adoption ; but the argument
seems unsound. The eldest child could not have seen his
grandfather after he was eleven,¹ and may not have been grown

¹ up when the Life was published—either quite a sufficient

reason why he should not be included in the dedication with
his mother and grandmother.¹ The family continued to exist
till the fifth century: the Emperor M. Claudius Tacitus (born

7 ΑΔ). 200) boasted of his descent from the historiam, and

Sidonius Apollinaris compliments his friend Polemius on the
same descent in a passage already cited (Ep. i. 14 init.)

It was either just before or shortly after his marriage that
  Tacitus was admitted by Vespasian to the quaestorship, and
’ so to the Senate. During the short reign of Titus he received

’ὲ some step of promotion, presumably the tribunate or aedile-

ship, which were now (Dio lii. 20) altematives in the series
of offices. We have seen already that it is a fair inference
from Pliny's language that before Titus’ death his position

Δ was unrivalled. The publication of the Dialogus is referred

 

to this time 3 the depreciation of modern oratory with which
it commences would come in better taste from a man who
had already gained such oratorical fame as the time afforded‚
than from an aspirant to it 3 and the complimentary allusion
to Vespasian is perhaps rather such as would be natural in
ι his son's day than in his own, while, on the other hand, it
seems to be proved by Agr. 2. 3, 3. 2, that during Domitian’s
reign Tacitus wrote or published nothing. Certainly that
passage is hardly consistent with his having taken so bold a
