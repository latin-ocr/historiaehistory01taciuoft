viii INTRODUCTION.

established, it was safer to mould the Senate by its means
than vto assert it against a hostile Senate. The consequence
waS, that the Senate ceased to be an aristocracy of birth,
without ceasing, any more than the English House of Lords,
to feel itself one. Every one whose father had been a Senator
was ῥύεο facto noble 3 old nobility had a sentimental advan-
tage over new 3 but the only distinction between senator and
senator that carried any practical advantage was the distinc-
tion, not of the date of the first honours gained by the family,
but of the height of the last. Pater consularis, avus praetorius
put Otho on a level, as a candidate for the Principate, with a
Crassus and a Piso. Vitellius was indebted, as Tacitus says,
to his father’s eminence for his consulship, his priesthoods,
his name and place in the foremost ranks 3 some said he was
indebted to the same cause for his ancient pedigree 3 but
whether his pedigree was ancient or modern made no differ-
ence to his being made Emperor.

There was also a special and comparatively recent influenee
at work to counteract any surviving reverence for the old
nobility above the new. Julius and Augustus had admitted
old families to the Patriciate 3 Claudius1 and Vespasian began
the admission of distinguished individuals belonging to new
ones. It does not follow because the Patriciate had long
ceased to have any political significance, that this deliberate
revival of it was without political effect. Under the early
Empire, a Drusus, an Ahenobarbus, or a Piso had been, in
his own eyes, and in those of his class, as much the natural
equal of a Caesar or a Nero as he had been under the
Republic‚ though there might be a few priesthoods to which
he was ineligible. But to a man of a respectable and re-

considered personal claims only.
