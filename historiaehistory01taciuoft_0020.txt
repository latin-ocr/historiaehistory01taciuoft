pertinent if it had been morally impossible—that he should
at that time have visited Maternus in his private room.

The Dialogue is plainly the work of a man who had
experience of the fashionable system of training in an unreal
rhetoric, which his Messala so earnestly condemns. At the
same time, educational systems are generally condemned by
those who have indeed been brought under them, but too
late, or for too short a time, to be moulded by them, and
the temper and opinions of Tacitus, as expressed in the
Dialogue, possibly also the eccentricities of his later style, are

his father's provincial engagements, or from some cause beyond
the reach not only of our knowledge but of our conjectures.

Both the matter and form of the Dz'alegue show that at

young orator's growing mind was that of Cicero and his con-
temporaries, and we may presume that as a speaker, no less
than as a writer, he acknowledged these as more or less his

three hints, not less trustworthy, because more delicate, than
Pliny's elaborate list of his second wife’s virtues in a published
