xviii INTRODUCTION.

and of the suspicions that the Emperor had been accessary
to it 3 afterwardS, though he was too candid to say that there
was any substantial grounds for these suspicions, he could
not shake off the prejudice that had been aroused by them.
Agricola doubtless was, as he ·looked‚ so good a man that
you were glad to be told he was a great one 3 his son-in-law
had quite made up his mind that he was a great man, and
thought that, if he had failed to achieve any great work, that
must be because he had been unjustly repressed by the fault
of others. And in truth it would doubtless have been wise,
and might have left some substantial results, if Domitian had
‘left him longer in his command in Britain 3—routine tradition
justified his recall, but there was no practical reason for it,
except a jealousy which was probably unreasonable, certainly
in fact unfounded. Or, if we admit the length of Agricola's
actual command, and the small importance of conquests in
Caledonia, as ,a sufficient reason for withdrawing him from
Britain, a sovereign who ‘loved a man’ would undoubtedly
have employed him in Dacia. Yetwhen he was crebro apud
Domitianum absens accusatus, absens absolutus, we may see
that Domitian’s jealousy did not, even when encouraged from
without, amount to active or, at least, deadly suspicion, and

· in the few years that followed, there was less than nothing

to arouse suspicion in Agricola's conduct. It is, of course,
possible that Domitian, though not prepared to murder an
innocent and popular man, may have felt a dishonourable
anxiety to know whether fate might rid him of one whom he
feared‚ but is at least equally possible, as Tacitus seems to
admit, that he was sincerely anxious not to lose the only
eminent man whom even he had learnt that he could trust.
Domitian had real faults more than enough 3 Tacitus allows
them to throw a shadow over his dealings with Agricola,
which, in all likelihood, were as frank as his nature allowed.
