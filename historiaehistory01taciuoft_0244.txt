CORNELII TACITI

Ad omnes exercitus legatosque scriptae epistolae, praeceptum-

magis imperii quam ministrum agens, non lento itinere, ne
cunctari videretur, neque tamen properans, gliscere famam
ipso spatio sinebat, gnarus modicas vires sibi, et majora credi

quas inermes exponi Vitellio, ni praesidiis firmarentur3 atque
ipsum Vitellium in incerto fore quam partem Italiae protegeret,
si sibi Brundisium Tarentumque et Calabriae Lucaniaeque

seemed enough to oppose to Vitellius
a part of their forces, the conduct
of Mucianus, the name ofVespasian‚
and lastly the omnipotence of
destiny.’ There is a sarcasm in
dux Mucianus as well as adversus
Vitellium: Mucianus was not exactly
a stick‚ but it was no compliment
to use him to beat a dog with. As
it turned out, his generalship was
never put to the proof : Antonius
Primus had decided the campaign
before he reached Italy.

Close the main port of communica-
tion with the south-eastern peninsula,
and then impede the· navigation to
more distant ones. The reader
win easily see and regret the temp-
tation felt by the copyists of the
secondary MSS. to add peteret after

CH. LXXXIV. 1 bem civilis
nervos] So Cic. Phil. v. 2. 5,
where he is speaking of a civil war,
but does not use the epithet, which
seems to indicate that then as now
the phrase was proverbial without
it. But the restrictiori to civil war
was more necessary in the age of
the Roman empire than in modern
times. A war like that between
Vitellius and Vespasian was more
like one between two civilized
European states than an invasion
of Germany or Dacia would have
been. It was only a civil war that
