lxiv . INTRODUCTION.

teristiC. One should however be noticed—the use osan ep-
exegetical or proleptic accusative, in apposition, so to speak, to
the action of the verb (see eg. Hist. i. 44. 3, and note). This
is partly a Graecism that had come into fashion since Cicero,
but mainly a peculiarity of his own. He introduces, on the
same principle, parentheses charactm'sing the action of the
verb.

ΙΙ. Tacitus' fondness for poetical language scarcely manifests
itself more frequently than Livy's, but he goes further in the
direction of pure poetry. Livy, it is noticed, begins his work
with the first four feet of a hexameter, and is rather fond of
ending a sentence with the last two 3 but Tacitus oftener com-
bines heroic rhythm with heroic style 3 in the Germany (39. 2)
he has one complete hexameter, much more like Virgil than
the lumbering groups of six feet that ingenious people can
detect in almost any prose, ag. the opening of the Annals, are
like even Ennius.

It is a question how far Tacitus' inclination for poetical style
was a matter of fashion‚ how far of personal taste. That the
former theory is not inadmissible is shown by Dial. 20. 5,
Exigitur enim jam ab oratore etiam poeticus decor, non Accii aut
Pacuvii veterno inquinatus, sed ex fflratii et Virgilii et Lucani
sacrario prolatus‚· horum igitur auribus et judiciis obtemperans
nostrorum oratorum ‘aetas pulchrior et ornatior extitit. But
with himself, if he does follow a fashion‚ the mark of indivi-
duality is strong 3 his language is not merely poetical, but
Virgilian. In the cases where he writes with a traceable
reminiscence of a particular passage, it is oftener one from
Virgil than from any prose author that he imitates—next most
frequently Livy, and perhaps Cicer03 Sallust not so often,
though in general style, and in some of his individual gram-

matical peculiaritieS, he resembles him more than any earlier
wrlter.
