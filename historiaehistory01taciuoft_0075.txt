INTRODUCTION. lxix

cited as M, tle„ Mediceus, but called M· where it is necessary
to distinguish it from the Ms. of the earlier books of the Annals,
also in the Florentine Library) and in these it seems that the
most conservative treatment is the wisest.

The only point upon which 1 thought it possible to improve
materially upon Orelli, is his orthography. No doubt on this
point more is known as to Latin usage than was known twenty-
seven years ago 3 and it is no doubt desirable that what is already
known to the learned should, as speedily as possible, be passed
on to the common stock of the well-informed. But it seemed to
be beyond the scope of the present work to enter into discus·
sions of the transt‘tt'onal usages of Tacitus’ time3 and Orelli's
usage is not really misleading‚ though it might have been better if
he had adhered more consistently to the Ms. reading in doubt·
ful or variable points, Every one now admits we ought to
write tempta, not tento as he did, and a few other corrections
might be pointed out, of much the same degree of importance ς
also it appears certain that Tacitus habitually wrote expecto,
extitit, etc„ not exs. In writing the syllable νῦ or vu, usage
was changing in Tacitus' time 3 in this point at least Orelli
adheres closely to his MS. evidence, and, Ι do not doubt,
rightly. But it seems a mere affectation to reject the distinc-
tion—which the ancient Latin alphabet craved for and the
modern has attained—between the vowels i and u and the

semivowelsj and v.
’ In exegesiS‚ I have found more help from Orelli's notes
than from any other source. It is rather strange that so diffi-
cult and yet so popular an author should have so few exegeti-
cal commentarieS. Next to Orelli, I have made most use of
Church and Brodribb's translation—to which I desire to do
justice here, because most of my mentions of it in the notes
express dissent. As a translation—a reproduction of the
original, to be read in its place—I think their work has been
