CH. LIX. 1 Julius lems]
Almost certainly the same person
as the leader of the great revolt
next ear, iv. 13. 2, etc. But
there e is called Claudius Civilis,
——probably a mere error, whether
on the part of Tacitus or of a
copyist. As the Gauls did not
mostly receive the citizenship till the
reign of Claudius, one would expect
them generally to bear his Gentile
name 3 in fact we find that of Julius
commoner. One may remember

, that the most distinguished houses

among them would be likely to
have received individual grants of
citizenship, before that to the nation
at large. It is scarcely likely that
he bore both names 3 if so, it would
be more appropriate to think of the
arbitrary grouping of names under
the lower Empire, than to refer to
the Sabellian custom of indicating
a man by two gentile names—appar-
ently those of his father and mother,
—though the name of Roscius Cae-
lius in the next c. seems to show
that this custom was not extinct.

2 Explains what made Vitellius

so anxious not to alienate the tribe;
they had quarrelled once already
with the legion they were attached
to, and their friendship or enmity
would give great weight to the side
into whose scale it was thrown.

4 valerius Asiaticus] Presum-
ably (though we have no direct
evidence) a son of Claudius’ victim,
Ann. xi. 1-3. From that-passage
it appears that the elder Valerius
and the elder Vitellius had been
friends, and perhaps their families
were already connected3 whence
Vitellius’ freedman (ii. 57. 3) very
probably got the name. But
Vitellius had been the determining
agent in Valerius’ death3 so this

marriage represents the reconcilia-
tion of a feud.

Junius Blaesus] He was after-
wards poisoned by Vitellius' orders,
iii. 38 sqq. He must have been
very old, if he be the son of
Q. Junius Blaesus, who was tribune
under his father (Anu. i. 19. 4) in
A.D. 143 perhaps that was rather
his father, who will then be one of
the two Blaesi that killed them-
selves in 36 (Anu. vi. 40.-3).

5 Ne . . . quidem] Even so
