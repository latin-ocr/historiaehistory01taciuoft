5] One may notice that the
soldiers bear the names of noble
houses, not that they belonged to
them, but that their ancestors a
generation or two back, possibly in
some cases themselves, had received
citizenship, perhaps liberty, from
‘those who did. Antonii are almost
as common as Cornelii, Julii, or
Claudii.

· 6 remedium in] ‘Did not oper·
ate as a remedy on.'

por artem ot tor-mimam] A
,ἔξω ωὲἰῐρεῄοὴτγ with an object

in 1 a ion.

Cn. XXI. 1 in turbido] The χ
expression is varied from that of
got-Zmint& rebus, merely for the sake

ane .

2 ringebat] ‘ He feigned’ to
himself as well as others, but the
oratio obliqua that follows is not to
be taken as a soliloquy.

exsim honorem] Not merely
‘honourable exile, i.e. disguised
under the name of honourable office 3
but hints that to be banished was
itself a compliment.

3 demna-mur] Used constantly
os popular report, as above, 13. 5.

4 Othonem] Apparently the
soree of using the pr. n. is to point
an antithesis with the two names
that follow, There were three men
in the field: os these, to murder
Otho was so easy, that, if action
against Galba was possible, action
against Piso must be prompt.

mendum] It was a state of
things where age, aude was the right
advice to give.

auctoritas] Almost ‘ the magic
of his name! Of course Galba's
impertiam remained unimpaired, and
it does not appear that Piso had
received it.

dum . . . maluisset] Dum is
osten used with a simple adj. as
predicate, where the copula (if
supplied) would be in the usual
tense, the pres. indic. Hence Taci-
tus was not conscious of the want of
a verb in the first clause3 when he
came to put one in the second, he
put it in the tense it should be, if

, cum not dum had preceded.
