One thing seems certain, that if
hostis be right, it must mean Vitel-
lius, not Celsus. Though properly
a foreign enemy, it can be used of
a rebel in arms against the state (see
84. 8), but not of a partisan hostile,
within the limits of patriotism, to a
defucto sovereign. For the rest, we
have two possible meanings for the
sentence as a whole t ‘ Otho did not
sincerely pard'on him, but spared
him as a measure for his own
security‚’ or ‘ Otho took the tone,
not of one pardoning a criminal,
but conciliating an honourable op·
ponent'; the former view seems
supported by the parallel passage
of Plutarch, the latter by that of
Dio. The reading must be deter-
mined according to which of these
seems intrinsically the likeliest3
with that of the text, we must

ham'ng need to sear the enemy‚'
which is harsh‚ no doubt, but not
quite impossible Latin.

beno] Probably dative.

6 integra et infelix] Tacitus is
fond of using the simple et thus,
with a special, osten ironical, force ;
ag. inf. 76. 2, ii. 49. 8.

CH. LXXII. 2 qula velocius
erat might mean that Tigellinus
chose the path of vice deliberately‚
as the shortest way to honour3 but
it seems to harmonize better with
Tacitus’ view of his character to
say, ‘he succeeded in his ambition,
because vice was the shortest way
to success.’

virffla scelera] Having gained
his position by the vices of a
woman, he hoped to retain it by
the vices of a man.

4 non clementia. . .

fugium] Cf. sup. 44 3.
