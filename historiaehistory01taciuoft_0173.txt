LIBER SECUNDUS.

STRUEBAT jam fortuna in diversa parte terrarum initia
causasque imperi0, quod varia sorte laetum rei publicae aut
affort, ipsis principibus prosperum aut exitio fuit. Titus Ves- 2
pasianus e Judaea, incolumi adhuc Galba, missus a patre

CH. Ι. 1 m divorsa parte]
Judaea is conceived as the extreme
south-eastern border of the empire‚

anxious to conciliate him, beyond
