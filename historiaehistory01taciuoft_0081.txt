defect would apply to writers of the
age of Augustus, the second to those
under the Claudii; of extant writers,
the first might include Livy, the
second would include Velleius..
The first charge (that indifference
to constitutional practice led to<
mistakes in constitutionalv theory)
perhaps lends some support to the
view of Niebuhr, that the ancient·
constitution was less understood,
and the ancient history less faith-
fully treated, by the Augustam
historians than by the antiquarians
of the second century.

mma] Neither the flatterers
nor the slanderers of the emperors
cared for posterity (whose only

· interest was to have truth told),

only to give vent to their ex parte
statements.

inter . . . vel] Because their
contemporaries, for whom they did
care, shared their own partial

assions or interests. One would
ave expected inter . . . atque,
but Tacitus has chosen to say ‘in
the midst of men either avowed
enemies or bound to servilityss
instead of ‘ benveen tlte hostile and
the servile.' For obnoxios, cf.
Livy xxiii. 12. 5, where it is opposed-
to superbus.

natural from the etymology, e.g.

SalL Jug. 45. 1. But the change
of sense came insensibly with the
change of govemment.
mauman] Comes παπ to the
sense os ‘ malignity,' being properly
‘giving a man less than his due.'

4 nostram] His own personaILy,—-
not his fami y’s,-which‚ however,
was of equestrian rank, and so not
noble, though respectable, a genera·
tion earlier,—sor the Cornelius Taci-
tus of Plin. JV. H. 7. 17. must have
been a relation, though it is only a
conjecture that he was his father.
He may have been a patrician Cor—
nelius3 at any rate, he has caught
the tone of a. Roman noble too well
to make us think that he oeme (as
is likely enough of Cornelius Laco,
and other soldiers of the name) of
the foreigners and freedmen with
whom Sulla had flooded Italy.

a. Dum-imo] Under him he was
Praetor and Quindecimvir (Anu.
xi. 11. 3),-and apparently a pro-
minent member of the Senate, as
he seems to reproach himself (Agr.
45. 1) for sharing its servility. We
can only inser from the ordinary
hierarchical routine what were the
dignities he held under Vespasiau
and Titus.

neque amore (nusquam et 81110

form enough of pointing an anti-
thesis, and Tacitus uses it here to
produce the sense, ‘having pro-
